\chapter{Optimization/Automatic Design of a HYDROMATRIX\circledR Turbine} % top level followed by section, subsection
Hydromatrix$\circledR$ is an axial reaction type water turbine (fig.\ref{Matrix_c}) developed by ANDRITZ HYDRO GmbH as an innovative solution for the development of low head hydropower sites \cite{matrix,matrix_2}. The concept behind Hydromatrix$\circledR$  idea is the use of a number of small non-regulated (fixed-blade) turbines in the place of a conventional large regulated one (fig.\ref{Matrix_a}) .  Regulation of a Hydromatrix$\circledR$ system can be achieved via closing/opening a number of turbines so to keep the massflow per open turbine as close as possible to there design point. If the flow exceeds the capacity, to avoid flood, a number of turbines can be raised or removed from its operating position like a gate (fig.~\ref{Matrix_a}).

Hydromatrix$\circledR$ ability to use existing weir structures reduces additional civil works to minimum and enables power plant operators to install hydroelectric power plants at extremely competitive costs with minimal environmental im-pact. The number of matrix turbines and their arrangement in rows depends on the existing civil structure and its position relative to the head- and tail-water elevations. The use of a number of small turbine generator units (also known as “modules”) results in simple and robust turbine and generator design. The standardized modular factory assembled grid or “matrix” ( fig.~\ref{Matrix_a}) results in short project schedules and high availability. A Hydromatrix$\circledR$ turbine consists of three different parts (fig.\ref{Matrix_c}). The distributor cone containing the stay-wanes, the runner and the draft-tube.

In order to achieve technical and economical feasible applications, the following main conditions have to be observed; 
\begin{itemize}
\item Available plant discharge from ~ $100 m^3/s$; 
\item Available head from 3 m up to 30 m; 
\item Minimum submergence 1.5 m below tailwater;
\item Unit output from 200 kW up to ~ 700 kW ;
\item Close grid connection ;
\item Structure available $\&$ suitable for HYDROMATRIX $\circledR$; 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Navigation dams; Large Lock $\&$ Dams navigational structures along a number of major rivers. 
	\item Irrigation dams; Many structures are existing for irrigation purposes worldwide, spilling water to agricultural areas on a regular basis.
	\item Sluice in shiplocks; Navigation river systems include dams and locks for ship transfer. Where an existing slot is available, a HYDROMATRIX $\circledR$ module can be installed for power generation. The turbine-generator units can be specifically designed to operate in both flow directions. Due to low operating heads feasibility has to be checked carefully. 
	\item Abandoned shiplocks; Due to increasing navigation and transport activities on major rivers the original shiplocks have become too small and new shiplocks were built.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Case formulation}
The design problem in hand consists of the design of the rotor blades, rotor hub and stay-vanes end-tips. Distributor cone, runner shroud and draft tube are fixed due to the pre-constructed modular contraction and the generator size (fig.\ref{Matrix_b}).

\caption{Matrix turbine schematic representation, with red are the free to design parts and black are the fixed due to construction constraints parts.  }
\label{Matrix_b}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Design parameterization}
The design vector in this case is split into 2 parts, one responsible for runner blade and hub and one for the stay-vanes. The first part is based on the general parameterization and is uses $nvar$ design variables to describe the rotor blades mean surface, thickness distribution and hub generatrices (table. \ref{design_vars2}). Second part of the parameterization is the part responsible for the stay-vanes TE, stay-vanes thickness distributions are frozen due to structural reasons (stay-vanes have to hold both the generator and runner weight in place) and stay-vane LE is fixed since the flow meats the stay-vanes with an axial velocity.
