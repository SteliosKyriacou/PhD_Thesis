                                Abstract
     The scope of this PhD is to propose a set of improvements to exist-
      ing design-optimization methods based on Evolutionary Algorithms
      (EAs) and demonstrate their efficiency in real-world applications, par-
      ticularly in the fields of hydraulic and thermal turbomachines. With
      the proposed algorithmic variants, the optimization turn-around time
      is noticeably reduced with respect to that of the background methods
      (as explained above) and becomes affordable even for large-scale in-
      dustrial applications.  The background design-optimization methods
      are based on EAs enhanced with the use of artificial neural networks
      (acting as surrogate evaluation models or metamodels).  The design
      process is coupled with the necessary Computational Fluid Dynamic
      (CFD) software.  Parallelization, in the form of concurrent evalua-
      tions of the candidate solutions within each generation of the EA, is
      absolutely necessary, given the high CPU cost per evaluation.  This
      is done based on the multi-processor platform of the Parallel CFD
      &amp; Optimization unit (PCOpt) of the National Technical University
      of Athens (NTUA). Using the proposed optimization methods sev-
      eral turbomachinery design optimization problems are solved; these
      include the design optimization traditional hydraulic-turbines such as
      Francis and a new/innovative variation of bulb turbines, the so-called
      &#8221;Hydromatrix&#x24C7;&#8221;, suitable for low head hydropower sites.  Further-
      more, the compressor cascade installed at the Lab of Thermal Tur-
      bomachines (LTT) of NTUA is optimized. A small number of math-
      ematical optimization problems are also solved since they allowed a
      great number of tests to be performed at negligible CPU cost.
      The most important contributions of this thesis are listed below:
                                                                               
        
                    DRAFT                                              
              &#x2219; A new design method which fully exploits a small number of archived
              designs with good performance in &#8220;similar&#8221; conditions.  In the pro-
              posed method, EAs (either in their conventional form or in enhanced
              variants assisted by metamodels) solve the design problem with a
              small number of free variables, the so-called optimization variables.
              The latter are used to non-linearly weight the archived designs so as
              to create new designs which are candidate solutions to the problem in
              hand; it is a great advantage of the proposed method that, by doing so,
              the EA avoids handling the, otherwise, great number of design vari-
              ables parameterizing the complex shape to be designed.  Gains form
              the reduction of the design variables are evident.  An extra gain in
              CPU cost arises from the use of the statistical analysis of the archived
              designs that helps identifying the most important design space re-
              gions which are then given greater probabilities of accommodating
              new offspring. The proposed method offers the additional advantage
              of automatic variable range definition.
              &#x2219; The use of principal component analysis (PCA) as a means to re-
              veal the topological characteristics of the current generation elite set.
              This characteristics are indicative of the correlations among the de-
              sign variables. The principal directions, as computed via PCA in each
              generation, are used for the rotation of the design variable coordinate
              system before the application of the evolution operators and there-
              fore transforms a ill-posed optimization problem into a well-posed
              one.  Applying the proposed PCA-driven evolution operators yields
              offspring generation of higher quality and, thus, reduces the number
              of generations required to get the optimal solution(s) without trunca-
              tion of the design variables.
              &#x2219; The bilateral use of the same PCA technique,  and the informa-
              tion about the design variable importance contained in the eigen-
              values, in both single- or multi-objective optimization problems to
              enchance the effectiveness of the inexact pre-evaluation (IPE) phase
                                                                                                                 

                    DRAFT                                              
      in metamodel-assisted EAs (MAEAs) working with radial basis func-
      tion (RBF) networks as metamodels.  The proposed method aims at
      obtaining more accurate predictions of the objective function by the
      online trained metamodels.  To this end, the PCA-driven rotation of
      the design variables followed by an appropriate truncation of the less-
      significant among them allow the use of metamodel trained on patters
      of smaller dimension. Thus, the training can rely on a small number
      of patterns, the RBF network prediction, as fur as driving the EA
      is concerned, is much better and overall the MAEA performs much
      better.
      The gain from the use of the proposed methods, either separately or in
      combination, is quantified not only by the mathematical test cases but
      also for real-world applications that have been solved both by the pro-
      posed method and the background optimization tool. In more detail
      the gain from the use of KBD is quantified by a 3D Francis hydraulic-
      turbine along side with a 2D compressor cascade case.  The use of
      MAEA(PCA) by the design/optimization case of a &#8220;Hydromatrix&#x24C7;&#8221;
      and the use of M(PCA)AEA(PCA) by the optimization of the 3D
      compressor cascade of LTT and a 2D compressor cascade.

                 mines very extended design variable ranges which must be used
                 for the optimization procedure to be able to reproduce them. The
                 case worsens if extrapolation possibility is desirable. This can sig-
                 nificantly deteriorate EA efficiency and also deems the use of meta-
                 models not profitable.   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    58

                 ison of four optimization runs, EA, KBD-EA, MAEA and KBD-
                 MAEA. EA and MAEA have similar convergence plots, since the
                 use of metamodels cannot not yield the expected gain, likely due
                 to the extended range of the design variables.  KBD-EA is signif-
                 icantly faster than both EA and MAEA, thus proving the merits
                 of the proposed method.  Furthermore, KBD-MAEA yields addi-
                 tional gain proving the positive effect that the proposed method
                 on the use of metamodels.   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    59

         value of x1  depends on the choice of x2  and vice-versa thus this

         two design variables was aligned to the x1 = x2  axis, the problem
         becomes separable.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    69

         quality of the network would be bad due to the scattering of the

           5.1  According to the EASY nomenclature, the evaluation of each new
                 candidate solution provided during the evolution starts by reading
                 the corresponding values of the design variables from the &#8221;task.dat&#8221;
                 file. A series of codes, being I/O compatible, are sequentially used
                 to finally create the &#8221;task.res&#8221; and &#8221;task.cns&#8221; files which indicate
                 the objective and constraint function values respectively.  A sin-
                 gle  evaluation  process  is  considered  to  be  terminated  once  the
                 &#8221;task.res&#8221; and &#8221;task.cns&#8221; files become available to the search en-
                 gine of EASY. The executable files required for a single evaluation

Introduction
Goal of this PhD thesis was to propose, develop and validate new methods aim-
ing at upgrading Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) into design-optimization tools
with reasonable computing cost capable to undertake large-scale industrial op-
timization problems in the fields of thermal and hydraulic turbomachines.  The
resulting EA, enhanced by the add-on methods proposed in this thesis, should be
able to produce high quality designs into acceptable, according to the industrial
standards, turn-around time. The later is, in fact, necessary for EAs to become a
design-optimization tool routinely used in an industrial environment. To achieve
the optimization turn-around time reduction,  a method which overcomes the
standard shape parameterization techniques which,  in real-world applications,
introduce a great number of design variables is the first proposed add-on.  In-
stead, this thesis proposes and evaluates a way to use the information residing
into available archived designs from similar successful projects worked out in the
past, by formulating and solving, through EAs, problems with much less design
variables. The proposed method combines &#8220;ideas&#8221; from the theory of Knowledge
Based Systems (KBS) with EAs, giving rise to a fast design method that will be
referred to as Knowledge Based Design (KBD). Furthermore, the degradation in
EAs efficiency/speed when used to solve ill-posed problems motivated the devel-
opment of a method that could recover a great part of the efficiency loss.  This
method makes use of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the
directions in the design space that, if used as design variables, would result in
a well-posed optimization problem.  This information is, then, used to modify
                                                            1                                                    

                    DRAFT                                              1. Introduction_______________________________________________________________________________
the evolution operators so as to operate in the most well-posed problem possible
and therefore recover as much efficiency loss as possible.  A by-product of the
aforementioned method was the assignment of &#8220;importance&#8221; to each and every
design variable (or design space coordinate). Metamodel-assisted EAs (MAEAs),
in which the costly problem-specific evaluation tool (CFD code, in the applica-
tions this thesis is concerned with) is replaced by surrogate evaluation models
or metamodels (usually trained artificial neural networks, ANNs, polynomial re-
gression methods, etc.)  may benefit from the importance-based ranking of the
design space coordinates, in order to overcome problems caused by the so called
curse of dimensionality.  A method that utilises this, via appropriate truncation
of the ANN entries, in order to create metamodels that are able to better drive
the evolution is proposed in this thesis.
   All of the aforementioned methods are validated in cases ranging from some
low-cost mathematical optimization benchmarks to 2D compressor cascade de-
signs and, finally, to the design of industrial 3D hydraulic turbines and a 3D com-
pressor cascade with tip clearance installed at LTT/NTUA. The mathematical
benchmarks have low computing cost and allow, thus, the exhaustive investiga-
tion of methods by performing several runs, using different seeds for the random
number generator, on the same case.  The presented 2D cases allow the demon-
stration of the methods in simple aerodynamic optimization cases. Furthermore,
two types of hydraulic turbines, a Francis and a new type named Hydromatrix&#x24C7;,
are used to validate the performance of the aforementioned methods in large-
scale industrial applications.  A number of performance metrics are introduced
and, depending on the case, are combined to form the objectives and constraints.
The Hydraulic turbomachinery design cases consider more than one operating
points, leading to an increased cost per CFD-based evaluation, which makes even
more valuable the reduction in the number of evaluations required to reach the
optimal solution(s). Finally, the airfoil of the 3D compressor cascade installed at
LTT/NTUA, aiming at minimum total pressure losses, is optimized.
   This PhD thesis is based on EAs developed in a number of previous PhDs (13,
78, 104, 110) performed at the Parallel Cfd and Optimization unit of LTT/NTUA
(PCOpt/NTUA). The previous PhD theses created the algorithmic basis (plat-
form), which the newly proposed methods were built upon. This EA-based plat-

        form, referred to as the EASY (Evolutionary Algorithm SYstem (74)) includes,
        the basic EA, optionally enhanced by parallel search (PEA), incorporation of
        ANNs as metamodels (MAEA) and hierarchical optimization schemes (HEA)
        provided fertile ground for the new methods proposed by this PhD thesis.
1.1    CFD-based Optimization
An overview of CFD-based optimization methods is presented in this section.
CFD-based  optimization  methods  enjoy  grate  interest  (figure  1.1)  from  both
academia and industry since the performance, and therefore the price, of products
ranging from cars and aircrafts to thermal and hydraulic turbomachines depends
heavily on their aero/hydrodynamic performance. The first ever essay that dealt
with the subject was done in 1910 by Hadamard (83) and utilised variation theory
for partial differential equations governing problems.

criterion was (Optimization AND CFD) OR (Optimization AND Computational
Fluid Dynamics). This is obviously a non-specific search, it is nevertheless capa-
ble to identify the trend associated with CFD-based optimization.  The steadily
growing number of publications in the last five years, as seen in figure 1.1, reveals
the growing interest in the subject in hand.  Therefore, the upgrades proposed
by this thesis are of interest to a, great and increasing in number, community of
scientist not only restricted in the field of turbomachines.
   A prerequisite for any CFD-based optimization is the availability of a fast
and reliable way to evaluate each candidate solution.  This is achieved through
the use of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) (hence the term CFD-based op-
timization) methods that numerically solve the differential equations governing
the fluid motion.  Nowadays, the relatively cheap access to powerful computa-
tional means has transformed CFD into a reliable and fast evaluation tool and,
therefore, the optimization methods that utilize it are flourishing. The strong cor-
relation among CFD-based optimization and computational resources is greatly
enhanced in cases where a number of disciplines, ranging from structural analysis
to manufacturing and economics, are used to evaluate the candidate solutions
(multidisciplinary optimization). The fact that the fluid dynamic, structural and
economical objectives may be contradictory adds extra difficulty to the optimiza-
tion procedure.
   Also, important part of the optimization procedure is the definition of the
design variables.  The aim of an optimization algorithm is to locate the set of
design variables that minimize the user defined cost function(s).  In CFD-based
optimization, the objectives are defined so as to describe the quality of the de-
sign.  Typical objectives are;  the maximization of efficiency, the minimization
of the deviation from given target distributions for the velocity or the pressure,
the minimization of total pressure losses or cavitation index (in hydraulic tur-
bomachines), etc.  Design-optimization problems with more than one objectives
(multi-objective optimization, MOO) can be solved simply by concatenating the
objectives into a single one through the use of weights. The difficulty of choosing
appropriate weight values and the failure of the approach in non-convex optimiza-
tion problems are two of its main weaknesses.  An improved way to solve MOO
problems is the use of dominance based methods that rank the candidate solutions
                                       4

        accoutring to Pareto dominance. This method returns a set of optimal solutions
        namely the so-called set of non-dominated solutions or Pareto front, where none
        of them is dominated by any other regarding all the objectives.  Therefore, the
        choice of the optimal solution to be adopted relies on other criteria to be used
        by the decision maker.  The design-optimization problem can, also, be subject
        to a number of constraints.  In CFD-based optimization, typical constraints are
        related to geometrical quantities (usually, thickness constraints), structural quan-
        tities such as maximum stress or deflection and flow-related quantities such as
        the minimum flow turning or the cavitation index.
           In general, CFD-based optimization can be classified in two categories, the
        direct and inverse design-optimization methods.  Direct methods solve the op-
        timization problem after a number of trials (53, 54, 78, 104, 147).  Each trial
        involves the geometry generation, CFD predictions, the objective function es-
        timation and ,likely, its gradient computation.  On the contrary, inverse design-
        optimization methods (should not be confused with inverse design problem 1 that
        can be solved by direct methods) (24, 37) begin from a set of desirable flow field
        characteristics (i.e.  boundary layer) and solve the inverse problem to define the
        geometry. The major advantage of inverse methods is their speed and their abil-
        ity to begin without a initial geometry. Their most noticeable drawback, on the
        other hand, is their inability to handle constrained optimization problems.  The
        inverse methods developed by LTT/NTUA are based on the Le Foll method (126)
        which uses two parameters to control the incompressible (laminar and turbulent)
        boundary layer.  This method was extended to facilitate compressibility (149),
        surface curvature effects in the calculation of the turbulent boundary layer (151)
        and boundary layer separation (150) and was later used for the design of both ax-
        ial and radial turbomachines. Based on the above classification, this PhD thesis
        is dealing with direct design-optimization methods.
           Examining the characteristics of the design-optimization method itself, they
        are classified into deterministic and stochastic. Deterministic design-optimization
        methods were used first in CFD-based optimization mainly due to their solid
        mathematical background and fast convergence, locate the optimal solution with

less candidate solution trials. The weakness of deterministic optimization meth-
ods is the necessity to calculate the gradient of the objective function(s) with
respect to the design variables. This limits the choice of objective functions since
they must be differentiable. Furthermore, the cost of the gradient calculation can
be noticeably high if access to the evaluation software source code is not granted
and therefore adjoin method cannot be used thus finite differences are utilised.
Furthermore, their difficulty in solving MOO problems by computing the ensem-
ble of non-dominated solutions and the danger risk of being trapped into local
minima (being gradient based methods) have to mentioned.
   For deterministic optimization methods, used in fluid dynamics design prob-
lems, except of the search method (steepest decent, Newton, e.t.c.)  the most
important part is the gradient calculation. The use of finite differences, as men-
tioned above, is not suitable since it requires, at least, as many flow predictions
as the design variables.  The use of adjoint techniques, though, can reduce this
number to a single flow field prediction irrespective of the number of design vari-
ables.  Due to the need of significant time and effort investment required by the
engineer (in the form of mathematical preparation and additional programming),
adjoint techniques were not used in CFD-based optimization since the mid 80s
(99, 100, 101, 153).   The two variants of adjoint techniques differ in the way
that the discretized adjoit equations are formed. The continuous adjoint variant
(12, 101, 147), is based on the continuous form of the flow equations in order
to derive the adjoint ones.  On the other hand, in the discrete adjoint variant
the adjoint equations result directly from the discretized flow equations (11, 51).
The main disadvantage of the discrete adjoint variant against the continuous
one, is the increased memory requirements. The accuracy of the two adjoint for-
mulations is, theoretically, identical; in practice this is true only for very dense
grids.  A more detailed presentation of adjoint methods used for fluid dynamic
optimization can be found in (147).
   Stochastic optimization methods, on the other hand, do not suffer for the
risk of getting trapped into local minima due to the probabilistic nature of the
candidate solution generation procedure. Furthermore, the differentiability of the
objective is not required. An additional positive feature of stochastic optimization
methods, especially regarding industrial use, is their ability to accommodate any
                                       6

        problem merely by providing the evaluation software, without necessary having
        access to its source code. Their main drawback, though, is the need to evaluate a
        great number of candidate solutions before reaching the optimum.  Thus, signif-
        icantly increasing the overall computational cost of the optimization procedure.
        This PhD is dealing with stochastic optimization methods and more precisely
        with EAs.
           The use of EAs in CFD-based optimization was delayed up until the mid 90s
        mainly due to their, as mentioned above, big computational cost. The first essays
        on the subject (66, 152, 158) present automated EA-based design-optimization
        procedures for aerodynamic design-optimization problems.  Soon after came the
        first attempts to reduce the cost of the overall optimization procedure, mainly by
        adapting the available coding and evolution operators. This trend continued with
        the hybridization with deterministic optimization methods. For instance, in (133)
        and (62), an EA is used to spot the starting point for a deterministic optimization
        method. Later, in (38), EAs were hybridized with Sequential Quadratic Program-
        ming (SQP) for constrained shape optimization problems. Furthermore, the use
        of distributed EAs (41, 169), surrogate evaluation models (49, 72, 77, 104, 162),
        hierarchical schemes (40, 47, 104, 120, 170) and concurrent evaluations in a mul-
        tiprocessor environment (13, 78, 127) were proposed.  Nowadays, the appeal of
        CFD-based EAs optimization regarding industrial-scale real-life engineering prob-
        lems is increasing, mainly due to the computational resources availability and the
        potential for significant gains both in design quality and design time and, there-
        fore, cost.  This PhD thesis is dealing with the use of EAs for solving industrial
        scale design-optimization problems in the fields of thermal and hydraulic turbo-
        machines in acceptable for industry turn-around time.
           Regarding CFD-based optimization in the fields of thermal and hydraulic
        turbomachines a inexact internet-based literature search has been carried out as
        before. The search criterion where; (a) optimization AND thermal AND turbo-
        machines and (b) optimization AND hydraulic AND turbomachines.  Though
        this is a non-specific search it reveals the steadily growing number of publications,
        in both thermal and hydraulic turbomachiens, over the last five years, as seen in
        figure 1.2. These by it self reveals the growing interest of the scientific community
        for CFD-based optimization in both fields.

   In ASME 2011 Turbo Expo conference 24 papers were published regarding
EA-based optimization in the field of thermal turbomachines, either CFD-based
or not. Most of them are handling a low number of design variables, N up to 15,
and only three (67, 117, 132) are handling high dimensional problems N &#x003E;30. In
(67) the application of an axisymmetric endwall contour for compressors is inves-
tigated and a EA-based optimization of the outer casing and the corresponding
blade tip airfoil section of a typical gas turbine high pressure compressor stage
with a high number of design variables (N =38) is presented. In (132) the high-
dimensional (N = 210) constrained multiobjective optimization of a fan stage
using EAs enhanced by metamodels is presented. In (117) an EA-based axisym-
metric multi-disciplinary optimization approach for compressors is presented and
applied to the design of a three stage booster with N =53 design variables. The
aforementioned papers even though they have high number of design variables
they typically start from an almost optimal design and therefore are able to as-
sign significantly low range to their design variables, i.e.   (132) starts from a
&#8220;pre-optimized&#8221; design and (67) has variable&#8217;s range in the tip clearance mag-
nitude.  The first method (KBD) proposed by this thesis is dealing with both

           In IAHR 2010 conference 5 paper regarding optimization in the field of hy-
        draulic turbomachines were published, among them 3 (81, 155, 161) used EAs.
        In (155) the weekly operation of a multipurpose hydroelectric development, in-
        cluding a pumped storage plant was optimized by an EA. In (161) a N = 2
        optimization problem concerning the design of an axial compressor cascade using
        a metamodel assisted EA was presented. In (81) a N =336 optimization problem
        concerning the design of a Francis hydraulic turbine was presented, the later was
        a result of this PhD thesis.
           Significant work, regarding CFD-based optimization in the fields of thermal
        and hydraulic turbomachines has been made in NTUA by the Laboratory of Ther-
        mal Turbomachines (LTT) and Laboratory of Hydraulic Machines (LHM) respec-
        tively.  Concerning thermal turbomachines, a number of papers regarding both
        deterministic and stochastic optimization methods have been published.  These
        were related to the optimal design of components of thermal turbomachines, such
        as compressor cascades, using a variety of optimization techniques. An indicative
        subset of them is mentioned below. The use of stochastic optimization methods
        coupled with computational intelligence is presented in (73, 75, 112). There, the
        use of artificial neural networks as metamodels, in order to assist the EA when
        dealing with costly evaluation tools such as CFD codes, were proposed, in fact
        these techniques are in use throughout this PhD thesis.   In (108), the use of
        metamodels trained both on responses and gradients is proposed and used in the
        inverse design of a 3D peripheral cascade.  In (113) the hierarchical distributed
        metamodel-assisted evolutionary algorithm was used for the loss minimization of
        a compressor cascade.  In (14) an asynchronous evolutionary algorithm is used
        for the optimal design of a 2D compressor cascade and in (15) a grid-enabled
        asynchronous metamodel-assisted evolutionary algorithm was utilized for the op-
        timization of a 3D annular compressor cascade. Furthermore, in (148), a adjoint-
        based deterministic optimization method is proposed for the total pressure losses
        minimization in turbomachinery cascade.  In (183) the computation of the ex-
        act Hessian matrix for efficient optimization using the Newton equation for the
        total pressure losses minimization in turbomachinery cascade is proposed.  Mul-

tilevel strategies that combine adjoint based methods with metamodels assisted
evolutionary algorithms for turbomachines were proposed in (109).
   Concerning CFD-based optimization in the field of hydraulic turbomachines,
the work done by LHM is related to; a) the optimal design of components of
hydraulic machines, such as runner blades, and b) the optimal design of complete
hydroelectric power plants and energy storage plants in combination with other
forms of renewable energy generation sources, such as wind energy. An indicative
subset of these work can be fount in the publications listed below. In (6) an EA
was used to improve the design of a microchannel structure used in a valveless mi-
cropump, the so-called &#8220;Tesla-Type Valve&#8221;. In (7) the fast Lagrangian approach
was used in collaboration with a EA to design an optimal Turgo turbine.  The
optimal sizing of a run-of-river small hydroelectric power plant utilizing an EA
was proposed in (8). Furthermore, in (9, 10) the optimization of pumped-storage
for wind power plants is presented.
1.2    Previews work by LTT/NTUA
An overview of four previous PhD theses on EAs carried out at the same research
group of NTUA is due.
   (78)  developed  a  generalised  EA  able  to  combine  components  of  the  two
most widely used evolutionary optimization methods, namely Genetic Algorithms
(GAs) and Evolutionary Strategies (ESs).  Furthermore, in the same thesis, the
use of artificial neural networks as local metamodels, trained on previously eval-
uated candidate solutions was proposed in order to reduce the computational
burden. To reduce the wall clock time of the optimization, parallel processing via
the PVM protocol was also introduced.
   (110) further improved the EA efficiency by focusing on the optimal use of
metamodels in multi objective optimization problems.  The main achievement
of (110) was that the MAEA became equally efficient in both multi- and single-
objective problems by overcoming problems related to; (a) the fact that the previ-
ously computed individuals, by the EA, in a multi-objective optimization problem
are spread rather than clustered around the sought optimal solution and (b) the
presence of outliers that require special treatment.   Distributed EAs (DEAs),

        were programmed and validated, these aimed at increasing the parallel efficiency
        of EAs, improving convergence and avoiding premature population stagnation.
        Furthermore the notion of Hierarchical EAs (HEAs) was introduced for the first
        time which was later refined in (104). In (110), the use of a DEA at each level of
        the HEA associated with different evaluation models was proposed.
           In (104), the HEAs were refined by introducing apart from hierarchy regarding
        the evaluation tool, hierarchical variants with respect to the parameterization
        and, even, the search method thus making possible the combination of EAs with
        deterministic optimization methods combining the advantages of both, stochastic
        and deterministic,  classes.   Furthermore,  the introduction of gradient trained
        artificial neural networks was proposed during the same thesis.
           Part of the fourth PhD thesis,  (13),  aimed at increasing the parallel effi-
        ciency of EAs or MAEAs. This was achieved by the introduction of the so-called
        Asynchronous EA (AEAs) or Asynchronous MAEAs (AMAEAs). By utilizing a
        number of strongly interconnected demes, the asynchronous variants may circum-
        vent the &#8221;end of generation&#8221; synchronization barrier and, thus, non interruptibly
        use all the available processors.
1.3    Structure of this Thesis
A short overview of the chapters of this PhD thesis follows:
   Chapter 2 presents the, pre-existing, algorithmic basis of this PhD. This in-
cludes the generalized EA with all its evolution operators, the metamodel assisted
EA and the Hierarchical EA.
   Chapter 3 is concerned with the first innovative method proposed in this PhD
thesis, i.e.  the one which was previously referred to as the Knowledge Based
Design (KBD) method.  In this chapter, a short overview of knowledge based
systems and, especially the case based reasoning (CBR) is presented.  Then the
proposed KBD method is presented in detail and used to perform the design of
a 2D compressor cascade, in order to demonstrate the merits of the proposed
method.
   Chapter 4 deals EAs and MAEAs suitable to solve ill-posed optimization
problems.  First the presentation of the characteristics of an ill-posed optimiza-

tion problem takes place.  Then the degradation of EA efficiency when they are
used to solve ill-posed optimization problems is investigated.  Furthermore an
innovative way to estimate directions in the design space that, if used as design
variables, would result in a well-posed problem is proposed.  New evolution op-
erators, the so-called PCA-driven evolution operators are proposed, in order to
recover the aforementioned EA efficiency loss and then are validated. Furthermore
the use of the importance information, resulting form the PCA is used to enhance
metamodel efficiency. Finally the combined gain of the aforementioned proposed
methods is validated through a 2D compressor cascade design-optimization case.
   In chapter 5, the efficiency gains from the use of the methods proposed in
this thesis are used to solve large-scale industrial cases from the field of hydraulic
turbomachines.  In more detail, the parameterization, grid generation and CFD
tools in use,  are presented.   Quality metrics that demonstrate each hydraulic
turbine quality regarding cavitation, blade loading and draft-tube coupling are
introduced.  Then the optimization of a Francis turbine, in the scope of a mod-
ernization/rehabilitation project, is used to demonstrate the merits of the KBD
method as opposed to a conventional EA. Furthermore the optimization of a new
type of hydraulic turbine, namely the Hydromatrix&#x24C7;, is used to demonstrate the
merits of the proposed PCA-driven evolution operators.
   Chapter 6 is dedicated to the design-optimization of the compressor cascade
installed at LTT/NTUA. This case is used to investigate the combined effects of
the use of PCA-driven evolution operators combined the PCA-assisted metamod-
els as proposed in Chapter 4.
   Finally Chapter 7 presents the conclusions of this PhD thesis.

Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)
2.1   Introduction - Overview of EAs
Several stochastic optimization methods have been inspired by and/or based on
Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution on the origin of species (22).  Hereafter, the afore-
mentioned methods along with their variants (there are plenty of them!)  will
be referred to as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) (134).  The increasing power
of modern computational platforms and their availability at relatively low cost,
combined with the inherent parallelization of population based algorithms sug-
gest that EAs, combined with existing analysis tools, could be used as efficient
industrial design tools. In our case, the analysis of problem-specific solution soft-
ware is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code.  The cost of running the
CFD code, quite often more than once if a multi-point design is carried out, times
the number of required evaluations determines the overall computational cost of
the EA-based optimization.
     An EA is a generation based, stochastic optimization method working with
populations of individuals evolving from generation to generation. Each individ-
ual &#x20D7; x represents a potential solution to the optimization problem in hand and
must be evaluated to obtain a measure of its &#8220;fitness&#8221; or &#8220;cost&#8221;, according to
user-defined objective functions.  In each generation, the EA selects the most
fit among the previous generation members (to be referred to as &#8220;parents&#8221;) and
evolves them by applying the so-called evolution operators (recombination, mu-

to better fit to an environment determined by the selected objective function(s).
   The first attempts to use EAs as problem solving techniques are dated back to
mid-50s and can be found in separate works by Friedberg, Bremermann and Box.
Friedberg (63, 64) presented an EA aiming at creating a program to perform a
given task; though quite premature, this was in fact an ancestor of evolutionary
programming (see below).  During the same period of time, Bremermann (20)
was among the first to apply EAs to numerical (linear and convex) optimization
problems including the solution of systems of nonlinear equations. Box proposed
the use of EAs as a method for improving industrial processes and increasing
industrial productivity (18, 19). By that time, these first attempts were treated
with considerable skepticism.  Soon after several methods, which initiated the
three broad classes of EAs, namely evolutionary programming (EP), evolutionary
strategies (ES) and genetic algorithms (GA), where brought to light.
   EP was proposed by L. J. Fogel by mid-60s (56, 57, 58). EP was developed by
considering machine learning tasks by means of finite state machines (FSM1). The
optimization problem was initially defined as evolving an algorithm (program) for
predicting arbitrary time series. In EP (60), each offspring is created by randomly
mutating each parent.  The offspring with the best value is, then, retained to
become a parent in the next generation. EP was successfully applied to problems
in prediction identification,  automatic control and pattern recognition.   Until
mid-80s, EP was confined to the FSM representation.  In 1986, though, EP was
extended to alternative representations including ordered lists for the travelling
salesman problem and real-valued vectors for continuous function optimization.
Later on, a self-adaptative EP (59) was proposed by including mutation variance
in the evolution.
   The first ES was proposed in 1965 by Rechenberg (89) using discrete, bino-
mially distributed mutations (centered at the parent&#8217;s position) and just a single
parent and a single offspring per generation.  Later on, ES was further devel-
oped both by Rechenberg (91) and Schwefel (146), by introducing recombination

        and adaptive mutation (90).  Using real-valued representation of the optimiza-
        tion variables, mutation is performed by adding a normally distributed random
        value to them. The introduction of recombination as an additional evolution op-
        erator for creating offspring, being impossible with just a single parent, led to
        multi-membered ES. This is usually referred to as a (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)ES, i.e.  an ES with
        &#x03BC; parents and &#x03BB; offspring.  One of the most successful variance of ES is the co-
        variance matrix adaptation ES (CMA-ES) (84). In CMA, the covariance matrix
        of the multivariate normal distribution, from which the candidate solutions are
        sampled is updated during the evolution. CMA-ES was found to be particularly
        useful for non-separable optimization problems. (140, 141).
           GAs were initially proposed, in 1962, by Holland (82, 93) as an evolution
        emulating tool for aiding the understating of the underlying principles of adaptive
        systems 1. In comparison to other contemporary researchers in the field of EAs,
        Holland focused differently and laid emphasis on the algorithmic nature of GAs
        in the sense that the mechanisms of reproduction and inheritance were based on
        operators well known from genetics 2 such as mutation, crossover and inversion.
        In addition, the representation of the evolving objects was made by using binary
        strings in direct analogy to the genetics genome. The binary string representation
        was one of the distinctions between ES and GA, considered as important at least
        in the early stages of their lives.
           The Genetic Programming (GP) was proposed, later, by Crammer in mid-80s
        (30) and, then, improved by Koza (123) aiming at the automated design of com-
        puter programs with the ability to perform a given computational task.  In GP,
        individuals (computer programs) are represented as tree structures 3 where each
        node is given an operator function and each terminal node an operand.  Repre-
        senting programs in this way offers easy evaluation and makes the application of
        the evolution operators possible, in the sense that recombination can take place

   In the Parallel CFD &amp; Optimization Unit of NTUA (PCOpt/NTUA), GA
and ES are both represented by a generalised (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA scheme (78, 104, 110), see
description in section 2.3. The (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA main characteristics are the population-
based evolution and the fact that the inheritance of candidate solution features is
based on both probabilistic criteria and decisions made upon a fitness or cost func-
tion, which quantifies the ability of each individual to survive in the user-defined
environment. The evolution, from each generation to the next, fig 2.1, is carried
out through the so-called evolution operators (recombination, elitism, mutation
and parent selection).  The generalised (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA, which is used and enhanced
in this PhD thesis, may operate as either a conventional ES or a conventional
GA, by carefully adjusting the algorithmic settings and the optimization variable
representation (binary or real).

   The two main advantages of EAs are their ability to: a) avoid being trapped
into local optima and, thus, locate the global optimum and b) accommodate any

        ready-to-use analysis software without requiring access to its source code.  The
        only prerequisite for carrying out an EA-based optimization is the availability of
        an evaluation software (even a commercial one, considered as a black&#8211;box tool
        within the optimization loop) for the specific optimization and well defined design
        variables and objective functions.  However, the need to evaluate all individuals
        in each generation, so as to assign fitness or cost values to all of them, is the weak
        point of all EAs, particularly if the evaluation of each candidate solution is com-
        putationally demanding. Optimization in aerodynamics or hydrodynamics which
        relies on expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software is a typical
        example.  This increases noticeably the optimization turn-around time and, of-
        ten, makes the whole process non-affordable for industrial use. To overcome this
        weakness, several techniques have been proposed in the literature (73, 102). These
        are classified in those reducing the optimization turn-around time by performing
        concurrent evaluations of the population members on a multi-processor platform
        and those reducing the number of evaluations needed to reach the optimal so-
        lution(s).  These two techniques can certainly be combined.  A first overview of
        these techniques is give below;
           A Parallel Evolutionary Algorithm (PEA) (13, 78, 104, 110) is an EA adapted
        to take advantage of the availability of a multi-processor platform, for reduc-
        ing the optimization turn-around time.  PEAs can be classified into single- and
        multi-population EAs. In a single-population or panmictic EA, each population
        member can, potentially, mate (recombined) with any other.  Standard way of
        parallelization is the concurrent evaluation scheme, with centralized selection and
        evolution (the so-called &#8220;master-slave&#8221; model).  A multi-population EA handles
        partitioned individual subsets, according to a topology which often maps directly
        onto the parallel platform and employs decentralized evolution schemes; these can
        be further classified in to distributed (87, 106, 112) and cellular EAs (44, 143),
        depending on the subpopulations&#8217; structure and granularity.
           All the aforementioned PEAs refer to synchronous EAs, in which the use of
        the multi-processor platform is restricted to the concurrent evaluation of candi-
        date solutions, without altering the, generation-by-generation, sequential nature
        of evolution in EAs.  This creates a synchronization barrier at the end of each
        generation; there, a number of processors may remain idle while waiting for the
                                                           17                                                   

                    DRAFT                                              2. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)_______________________________________________________________________________
remaining generation members to be evaluated.  In order to minimize (practi-
cally eliminate) the idle time of processors, asynchronous EA (AEA) (5, 14) have
been developed. The AEA proposed by PCOpt/NTUA overcomes the sequential
nature of evolution by applying the evolution operators to a number of strongly
interacting (overlapping) demes, which may optimally use all the available pro-
cessors.
   A metamodel-assisted EA (MAEA) employs low-cost surrogate evaluation
models, i.e.  the so called &#8220;metamodels&#8221;, as often as possible, during the opti-
mization. This decreases substantially the number of calls to the computationally
expensive, problem-specific evaluation code (such as the CFD software). Polyno-
mial regression, artificial neural networks, Gaussian processes etc. have all been
used as metamodels. Schemes based on different interactions between the meta-
model and the problem-specific evaluation tool can be found in the literature
(52, 73, 102, 116).  MAEA implementations can be classified in two basic cate-
gories, depending on whether the metamodel(s) is/are trained before (off-line) or
during (on-line) the evolution.  Additionally, global (i.e.  a single metamodel for
the entire search space) or local (i.e.  each of which being valid over a different
part of the search space) metamodels can be used.
   Additional reduction in the optimization turn-around time can be achieved by
employing hierarchical EAs (HEAs) or MAEAs (HMAEAs)(87, 104, 106, 110, 113,
129). These are built based on a small number of interconnected levels. On each
level, different search methods, different evaluation software and/or different sets
of design variables can be employed. One- or two-way inter-level communication
schemes can be used. On levels employing EA-based search, a PEA or MAEA or
both can be used. Multi-level optimization algorithms can, generally, be classified
as follows (115):
   (a) Multi-level Evaluation, where each level is associated with a different eval-
uation software. The lower levels are responsible for detecting promising solutions
at low CPU cost, through low-cost problem&#8211;specific evaluation models, and de-
livering them to the higher level(s).  There, evaluation models of higher fidelity
and CPU cost are employed and the immigrated solutions are further refined.
   (b) Multi-level Search, where each level is associated with a different search
technique.  Stochastic methods, such as EAs, are preferably used on the lower
                                      18

        level(s) for the exploration of the design space, leaving the refinement of promis-
        ing solutions ,often , via gradient-based methods on the higher level(s).  Other
        combinations of search tools are also possible. Memetic algorithms (68, 69, 122,
        124, 144, 145) is a class of multi-level search that combines global and local search
        methods, where the latter aims at improving the quality of promising solutions.
           (c) Multi-level Parameterization, where each level is associated with a different
        set of design variables. On the lowest level, a subproblem with just a few design
        variables is solved. On the higher level(s), the problem dimension increases. The
        most detailed parameterization is used on the highest level.
2.2    Optimization problems - Definitions
Any optimization problem with M objectives (cast in vector &#x20D7; F) and K constraints
(cast in vector &#x20D7; C) can be formulated as:
                   min &#x20D7; F(&#x20D7;x) = (f1(&#x20D7;x),f1(&#x20D7;x),...,fM(&#x20D7;x)) &#x2208;&#x211C;M
                   subject to ck(&#x20D7;x) &#x2264; dk,     k = 1,K                      (2.1)
where &#x20D7; x &#x2208; X &#x2264;&#x211C;N  is the design vector and X the design space.  If equality
constraints c*(x) = d* are to be imposed, these can be transformed into inequality
ones c(x) = &#x2225;c*(x) - d*&#x2225;&#x2264; d, where d &#x2208;&#x211C; is an infinitessimally small number.
If M &#x003E;1, problem 2.1 represents a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem;
in such a case, the notion of Pareto dominance (185) is used to associate a scalar
cost value to each individual, based on which an algorithm solving single-objective
optimization (SOO) problems can be employed. In MOO problems, a single run
of an EA is capable of delivering a Pareto front of non-dominated individuals,
rather than a single &#8220;optimal&#8221; solution, standing for a compromise among the
various objective functions.
2.2.1   Multi-Objective Optimization and EAs
In contrast to SOO, where the scalar cost function, which defines the survival
of candidate solutions from generation to generation,  is derived directly from
the objective function, a MOO problem solver handles a vector of objectives.
                                                           19                                                   

                    DRAFT                                              2. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)_______________________________________________________________________________
Therefore,  in order to rely on the proposed for solving SOO problems EA, a
technique to transform this vector to an appropriate scalar cost value is needed.
In the literature, several techniques for handling this problem exist (26, 28, 137).
The most commonly used among them concatenate the M objective functions
into a scalar cost function, either by associating weights to each one of them or
by accounting for the distance between the candidate solution and a user-defined
ideal design or, even, using ranking techniques based on the notion of Pareto
dominance (see below). In this PhD thesis, all MOO problems are handled using
techniques relying on Pareto dominance criteria.  Different implementations of
Pareto dominance based techniques exist in the literature; among them, the most
widely used ones are MOGA 1 (61), NPGA 2 (88), NSGA 3 (172), NSGA2 (35),
SPEA 4(188), SPEA2 (186, 187), PAES 5 (119) and PESA 6 (29). The definition
of Pareto dominance and Pareto optimality in minimization problems, which the
aforementioned techniques rely on, follow:
Pareto Dominance:   Solution &#x20D7; x1  dominates solution &#x20D7; x2  (&#x20D7;x1 &#x227A; &#x20D7; x2) if and only
if &#x20D7; F(&#x20D7;x1) is partially less than &#x20D7; F(&#x20D7;x2), i.e.
      &#x20D7;x1 &#x227A; &#x20D7; x2 &#x21D4; (&#x2200;i &#x2208; [1,M] : fi(&#x20D7;x1) &#x2264; fi(&#x20D7;x2)) &#x2227; (&#x2203;i : fi(&#x20D7;x1) &#x003C; fi(&#x20D7;x2))      (2.2)
Pareto Optimality:   Solution &#x20D7; x1 &#x2208; X is a Pareto optimal solution with respect
to X if and only if there is no &#x20D7; x &#x2208; X that dominates &#x20D7; x1, or
                       &#x2204;&#x20D7;x : &#x20D7; x &#x227A; &#x20D7; x1,    &#x20D7; x,&#x20D7; x1 &#x2208; X&#x2286;&#x211C;N                      (2.3)
   In fig.  2.2, a schematic representation of the Pareto optimality is presented.
A minimization problem with two objective functions, f1  and f2, is considered.

2.2.2   Constrained Optimization and EAs
In engineering, almost all optimization problems are subject to constraints which
split the design space in feasible and infeasible regions.  EAs may handle con-
straints through (a) the use of penalty functions (34, 139), by assigning greater
chances to survive to individuals satisfying the constraints (156), (b) the con-
version of constraints into objectives (173, 174) and/or (c) the use of correction
operators (136).  A detailed survey on the subject can be found in (27, 135).  In
the present thesis, penalty functions are used as presented in section 2.3.3.

2.3    The Evolutionary Algorithm SYstem (EASY)
EASY is a generic optimization platform which implements the (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA (74,
78, 104, 110).  EASY has been developed by PCOpt/NTUA and the techniques
proposed in this thesis have all been built on EASY. EASY supports MAEAs
using on- or off-line trained metamodels, various forms of multi-level optimiza-
tion as described in section 2.1, distributed and asynchronous search; it is also
Grid/Cluster-computing enabled, based on the DRMAA library (128). A detailed
analysis of the implemented (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA, considered as the background optimization
method in this thesis, follows.
2.3.1   The (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA
Each generation, denoted by the superscript g, of the (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA is associated with
three dynamically updated populations: the offspring Pg
&#x03BB;  population with &#x03BB; off-
spring, the parent Pg
&#x03BC; population containing &#x03BC; parents and the elite Pg
e  population
with e elites. Pg
e  contains all or some of the currently best individuals. Depending
on the design variables coding (binary, binary Gray or real), appropriate evolution
operators are applied.
   The background (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA in use, (78), is based on the following steps:
     Step 1: (Initialization) g = 0, Pg-1
e     = &#x2205; and Pg
&#x03BC; = &#x2205;. All Pg
&#x03BB;  members are
      initialized using a pseudo-random number generator, in accordance to the
      user-defined lower and upper bounds of each design variable. A number of
      user-defined individuals, such as existing sub-optimal solutions to the same
      problem or optimal solutions to similar problems can optionally be included
      in to the initial population.
     Step 2: (Evaluation) All individuals in Pg
&#x03BB; are evaluated using the problem-
      specific evaluation model.  In all applications this thesis is dealing with,
      this is a CFD code.  Later, in the MAEAs, this will also be referred to as
      &#8220;exact evaluation model&#8221; to clearly distinguish it from evaluations (pre-
      evaluations) om cheaper surrogate models. The evaluation step is, always,
      considered to be time-consuming and yields the vectors &#x20D7; F(&#x20D7;x) &#x2208;&#x211C;M for each

&#x03BB;  &#x222A; Pg
&#x03BC; &#x222A; Pg-1
e    , a scalar cost
              &#x03A6;(&#x20D7;x) value is assigned based on &#x20D7; F(&#x20D7;x). In SOO, &#x03A6;(&#x20D7;x) &#x2261; F(&#x20D7;x). In MOO, the
              techniques presented in section 2.3.2 are employed.
               Step 4:  (Elite selection) The e* non-dominated individuals (in a MOO
              problem) or the best (SOO) one in Pg
&#x03BB; &#x222A; Pg-1
e     are selected to enter Pg
e .  If
              e* &#x003E;e, a thinning operator (78) can be applied to remove the e*-e excess
              individuals.
               Step 5: (Elitism) A small number of elite individuals, selected at random
              from Pg
e , replace the worst members of Pg
&#x03BB;.
               Step 6: (Parent selection) The new parent population Pg
&#x03BC;  is selected from
              Pg-1
&#x03BC;     and Pg
&#x03BB;  by taking into account the scalar cost &#x03A6; values computed in
              step 3, and the maximum allowed age &#x03BA; (measured in generations) of each
              individual. Symbolically, Pg
&#x03BC; = S(Pg-1
&#x03BC;    ,Pg
&#x03BB;,k)
               Step 7:  (Recombination and mutation) The next generation of the off-
              spring population Pg+1
&#x03BB;     is derived from Pg
&#x03BC;  by applying the recombination
              (or crossover) and mutation operators.  Recombination <img src="eusm10-c-52.png" alt="R" />() is the process
              of combining the genotype of a number (&#x03C1;) of parents to create an offspring
              (see 2.3.1.1). The recombination operator is used &#x03BB; times, using differed sets
              of &#x03C1; parents, randomly selected from Pg
&#x03BC;, to create &#x03BB; new offspring.  Next
              step is the application of the mutation operator.  Mutation <img src="eusm10-c-4d.png" alt="M" />() is a pro-
              cess which, with a small probability, randomly alters parts of the individual
              genotype. Symbolically, Pg+1
&#x03BB;     = <img src="eusm10-c-4d.png" alt="M" />(<img src="eusm10-c-52.png" alt="R" />(Pg
&#x03BC;)) (see 2.3.1.1).
               Step 8:  (Stopping criterion) Unless any of the stopping criteria is met,
              return to Step2.

2.3.1.1   Evolution operators
The evolution operators employed in EASY are the parent selection, recombina-
tion, mutation and elitism. These are further discussed below:
Parent selection:   The parent selection operator selects the members of Pg
&#x03BC;
from a set of individuals;  in EASY, based on the sixth step of the algorithm
presented in section 2.3.1, this set is the union of Pg-1
&#x03BC;     and Pg
&#x03BB;. The most common
(175) parent selection techniques are:
     a) Proportional selection. Each member of Pg-1
&#x03BC;    &#x222A; Pg
&#x03BB;  is given a proba-
      bility to become a parent, which is inversely proportional to its cost value
      &#x03A6;.  Recall that a minimization problem is to be solved.  The proportional
      selection is, practically, implemented via a roulette wheel algorithm.  On
      the roulette wheel each and every set member is associated with a slot, the
      angular size of which is proportional to its probability to become a parent.
      The roulette wheel is used &#x03BC; times so as to create &#x03BC; parents.
     b) Linear ranking. In linear ranking, the Pg-1
&#x03BC;    &#x222A; Pg
&#x03BB;  members are sorted
      according to their &#x03A6; values. The probability of each one of them to become
                                      24                                      
        
                    DRAFT                                              2.3 The Evolutionary Algorithm SYstem (EASY)_______________________________________________________________________________
              a parent depends linearly on its position in the corresponding list and not
              on the &#x03A6; values themselves.
               c) Probabilistic tournament selection.  In probabilistic tournament
              selection (79), a number of individuals are selected at random from the
              Pg-1
&#x03BC;    &#x222A; Pg
&#x03BB;  set and with a user-defined, typically high, probability the best
              individual from this group is selected to become a parent, otherwise a ran-
              domly chosen, among the remaining individuals, becomes a parent.  This
              process is repeated &#x03BC; times.  In tournament selection, the most important
              user-defined parameters are the tournament size, i.e.  how many individu-
              als participate in each tournament, and the probability of the best among
              them to be selected as parent.  Typical values are:  participation of 2 or 3
              individuals in each tournament and 80%-95% probability to select the best
              among them.
Recombination:   Since the first appearance of EAs, there has been numerous
discussions (32, 33, 130) about the advantages of employing the recombination
operator. In general, the purpose of recombination is to increase the probability
of an offspring to become fitter than its parent(s).  Recombination schemes can
be classified depending on the design variable&#8217;s coding.
   In EAs based on binary coding,  the recombination operator undertakes
the exchange of pieces of the binary string encoding the design vector between
the parents, in order to create an offspring.  In EASY, the following types of
recombination which are appropriate for use with binary coding exist:
     a) One-point recombination.  In the one-point binary recombination,
      with &#x03C1; parents per offspring, the binary string is divided into &#x03C1; - 1 parts
      of equal length in binary digits.  Then, &#x03C1; parents are selected at random
      from the Pg
&#x03BC;  set and, using them, (&#x03C1; - 1) pairs of parents are formed; all
      of them include the first parent.  If the first parent is denoted by 1, the
      (&#x03C1; - 1) pairs are:  (1, 2), (1, 3),..., (1,&#x03C1;).  For each one of the (&#x03C1; - 1) pairs,
      a random integer <img src="eusm10-c-58.png" alt="X" /> determines the corresponding crossover point.  Each
      offspring is formed by combining the left part of the first parental string
                                                           25

      and the right part of the other parent, according to the aforementioned
      pairings. A three-parent example (&#x03C1; = 3) is presented in fig 2.3.
                                                                                                                                                               
  Figure 2.3: One-point binary coding recombination with &#x03C1; = 3. In this case, the
  chromosome is divided in two parts (&#x03C1; - 1 = 2) and two vertical cuts are created
  at random.
     b) Two-point recombination.  This scheme is similar to its one-point
      counterpart, the only difference being that two crossover points <img src="eusm10-c-58.png" alt="X" />1  and <img src="eusm10-c-58.png" alt="X" />2
      are used. A two-parent example is illustrated in fig 2.4.

  case, the chromosome is handled as a whole (&#x03C1; - 1 = 1) and two vertical cuts are
  created at random.
     c) One- or two-point recombination per design variable. Here, the
      aforementioned one- and two-point recombination schemes are separately
                                      26

              applied to the parts of the binary string that correspond to each design
              variable.
           Using real coding, the recombination operator must be applied directly to
        the real-valued design variables. In EASY, this is carried out as follows:
               a) One- or two-point recombination. The one- and two-point recom-
              bination schemes, as described for binary coding, can be adapted to real
              coding by exchanging pieces of the design vector &#x20D7; x instead of pieces of bi-
              nary strings.  The randomly selected crossover variable is the only one to
              be affected by both parents according to a randomly generated weight r. A
              one-point, two-parent example is presented in fig. 2.5.
                                                                                                                                                                       
   Figure 2.5:  One-point real coding recombination with &#x03C1; = 2.  The superscript
   denotes the parent and the subscript the design variables.  The crossover variable
   (e.g. 5) is selected at random. In the offspring, this variable is given by x1,2
5    = x1
5 +
   r(x25-x15), where r is a random number, uniformly distributed in [0,1] (r &#x2208; U(0,1)).
               b) Discrete recombination.  In discrete recombination with &#x03C1; parents,
              each real-valued design variable in the offspring has 50% probability to be
              copied either from the first parent &#x20D7; x1 or any other &#x20D7; x random randomly chosen
              among the &#x03C1; - 1 remaining ones.  A three-parent example is presented in
              fig. 2.6.

  Figure 2.6: Discrete real coding recombination with &#x03C1; = 3.  &#x20D7; x1 is the first parent.
     c) Intermediate recombination.  In intermediate recombination, each
      component of the offspring &#x20D7; x is a linear combination of the first parent &#x20D7; x1
      and &#x20D7; x random, which is randomly chosen among the &#x03C1; - 1 remaining ones.
      Thus,
                      &#x20D7;x = &#x20D7; x1 + r(&#x20D7;x random - &#x20D7; x1), r &#x2208; U[0, 1]
      where r &#x2208; U(0, 1) means that r is a random number, uniformly distributed
      in [0, 1]. A different random number is generated for each design variable.
     d) Simulated binary crossover. The so-called simulated binary crossover
      (SBX) (36) aims at recreating the one-point binary recombination by repli-
      cating its (a) average property 1 and (b) spread factor property2(36). The
      offspring &#x20D7; x is generated based on the formulas
                     &#x20D7;x = { &#x20D7;
    _x - &#x03B2; 
2 (&#x20D7;x random - &#x20D7; x1)  ,r &#x003C; 0.5
    &#x20D7; x + &#x03B2; 
2 (&#x20D7;x random - &#x20D7; x1)  ,r &#x2265; 0.5                (2.4)
      where r &#x2208; U[0, 1], &#x20D7; x1  the first parent, &#x20D7; x random is randomly selected among
      the &#x03C1;- 1 remaining parents, &#x20D7; x is the middle point between &#x20D7; x1 and &#x20D7; x random
      and
                           &#x03B2; = { (2r)n
         ,r &#x2264; 0.5
    ( 1 _

     n+2

_______________________________
    1The average of the decoded variable values is the same before and after the crossover
operation.
     2The spread factor (&#x03B2;) is defined as the ratio of the spread of offspring to that of parents.
Contracting, expanding or stationary recombination correspond to &#x03B2; &#x003C; 1, &#x03B2; &#x003E; 1 or &#x03B2; = 1
respectively.  The spread factor property states that the occurrence of spread factor &#x03B2; &#x2248; 1 is
more likely than any other &#x03B2; value.

              Given that r &#x2208; U[0, 1], the probability distribution of &#x03B2; can be plotted for
              various values of n based on eq.2.5 (fig.2.7, left). Based on the &#x03B2; probability
              distribution and eq.2.4, the probability distribution of the offspring appear-
              ance on the design space as a function of n can be plotted (fig.2.7,right for
              a 1D problem and fig.2.8 for a 2D problem).  In general, higher n values
              increase the probability of &#x03B2; &#x2248; 1, which in turn increases the probability of
              creating near-parent offspring (spread factor property). This together with
              the symmetrical offspring probability distribution with respect to &#x20D7; x (aver-
              age property) shows that the &#8221;SBX&#8221; may in fact simulate the one point
              binary crossover.

  using SBX recombination for n = 0 (left) and n = 2 (right) is presented.  The

Mutation:   In an EA, the role of mutation is to introduce and preserve diver-
sity in the population.  Thus, mutation prevents the population from becoming
prematurely homogenised, in which case slow or stagnated evolution is expected

        viewpoint, mutation depends on whether binary or real coding is used.

where gmax the number of maximum generations and r2 &#x2208; U[0, 1]. Alternatively,
should the termination criterion be based on the number of evaluations, g&#x2215;gmax
must be replaced with Ev&#x2215;Evmax where Ev is the evaluation counter and Evmax
the maximum allowed number of evaluations.
Elitism:   In EAs, the purpose of elitism is to guarantee a monotonously improv-
ing course of evolution (175). In EASY, a separate population Pg
e  is maintained
and updated accordingly at the end of each generation (step 4 of the (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA,
section 2.3.1).  Elitism implies that a user-specified number of elite individuals
replace the worst members of the offspring population Pg
&#x03BB;, prior to the application
of the parent selection operator.
2.3.2   Solving MOO Problems with EASY
As mentioned in 2.2.1, in MOO problems, a technique that transforms  &#x20D7; F into a
scalar cost function &#x03A6; is required. Symbolically,
                        &#x03A6;(&#x20D7;x) = &#x03A6;(&#x20D7;F(&#x20D7;x)) : &#x211C;M &#x2192;&#x211C;1                       (2.9)

        The SPEA, SPEA2 and NSGA2 techniques, which are available in EASY, are
        presented below:
SPEA:   SPEA was proposed by Zitzler and Thiele (188) in 1998 as a MOO cost
assignment technique based on Pareto dominance.  In SPEA, &#x03A6;(&#x20D7;x) is computed
in two steps as follows:
     Step 1: (Strength calculation) The strength of each member of the popu-
      lation P = Pg
&#x03BB; &#x222A; Pg
&#x03BC; &#x222A; Pg-1
e     is computed.  The strength of the individual i
      (Si) is defined as the sum of the population members that are dominated
      by i divided by the population size,
              Si = &#x2211;
  (j : j &#x2208; P &#x2227; i &#x227A; j) 
          &#x2211;
       P         ,  &#x2200;i &#x2208; P = Pg
&#x03BB; &#x222A; Pg
&#x03BC; &#x222A; Pg-1
e         (2.10)
     Step 2: (Cost calculation) The cost value &#x03A6; for each population member
      is calculated as the sum of strengths of the population members which
      dominate it,
                                &#x03A6;i =   &#x2211;
 j&#x2208;P&#x2227;i&#x227A;j(Sj)                         (2.11)
SPEA2:   SPEA2 (186, 187) is an enhanced variant of SPEA which additionally
incorporates density information.  A nearest neighbour density estimation tech-
nique which allows a more precise guidance of the search process is incorporated,
thus improving, in comparison with SPEA, the distribution of the individuals
along the Pareto front.
   The SPEA2 algorithm performs three steps to compute &#x03A6;. These steps are:
     Step 1: (Strength calculation) As in SPEA.
     Step 2:  (Density calculation) For each population member, the density
      metric Di is calculated as a function of its distance from its closest neighbour
      in the objective space di,
                                                           33

                                  Di =    1 ___
di + 2                           (2.12)
      where
                          di = min(&#x2225; &#x20D7; Fi - &#x20D7; Fk &#x2225;), k &#x2208; P
     Step 3: (Cost calculation) The cost values for all population members are
      calculated as the sum of the raw cost Ri and the density metric, Di,
                                  &#x03A6;i = Ri + Di                          (2.13)
      Here, Ri is the sum of the individual strengths of the population members
      that dominate it,
                                Ri =   &#x2211;
 j&#x2208;P&#x2227;i&#x227A;j(Sj)
NSGA2:   NSGA2 (35) is an improved version of NSGA (172) addressing the
high computational complexity of non-dominated sorting, the lack of elitism and
the need for specifying the sharing parameter of the initial algorithm. A modified
version of NSGA2 is available in EASY. As proposed in (35) instead of calculat-
ing &#x03A6; values, NSGA2 relies upon the sorting of individuals according to Pareto
dominance and density criteria. The modified, so as to calculate &#x03A6; values, variant
of NSGA2 used in this PhD thesis includes the following steps:
     Step 1:  (Front ranking) All members of the population are classified in
      fronts with decreasing Pareto dominance.
            Step 1-a:  (Initialization) Initialization of front number i = 0 and
           auxiliary set S = Pg
&#x03BB; &#x222A; Pg

e    .
            Step  1-b:  (Find  non-dominated  members  of  S)  Locate  the  non-
           dominated members of S and copy them to <img src="eusm10-c-46.png" alt="F" />i.

                   Step 1-c: (Update) Update S = S -<img src="eusm10-c-46.png" alt="F" />i and i = i + 1.  if S &#x2044;=  go
                   to Step 1-b else, set the number of fronts NF  equal to i - 1 and go to
                   Step 2.
               Step 2: (Density calculation) For each member j &#x2208;<img src="eusm10-c-46.png" alt="F" />i, the density metric
              dj, which is equal to the average side-length of the cuboid defined by its
              neighbouring individuals in <img src="eusm10-c-46.png" alt="F" />i, is calculated. This procedure is repeated for
              all fronts i, so as all individuals are given a density metric value.
               Step 3: (Cost calculation) Based on the density metric (calculated in Step
              2) and the front i (calculated at Step 1) that each individual belongs to, a
              scalar &#x03A6; is assigned to each individual as follows,
                    Step 3-a: (Initialization) Initialise i = 0 and &#x03A6;b = 1.0.
                    Step 3-b: (&#x03A6; calculation) For each member j &#x2208;<img src="eusm10-c-46.png" alt="F" />i, &#x03A6; is calculated as
                                       &#x03A6;j = &#x03A6;b(1 + dmax - dj 
    dmax    )
                   where dmax the maximum dk &#x2200;k &#x2208;<img src="eusm10-c-46.png" alt="F" />i
                     Step 3-c: (Update) Update &#x03A6;b = 1.1max(&#x03A6;j) and i = i+1. If i &#x2264; NF
                   go to Step 3-b, otherwise stop.
2.3.3   Constraints handling in EASY
In EASY, penalty functions are used to handle constraint optimization problems
(COP), see section 2.2.  Penalty terms, proportional to the magnitude of the
constraint violation, are added to the cost function.  According to eq.2.14, for
each constraint, a &#8220;nominal threshold&#8221; dk  is defined as the maximum possible
constraint function value as described by the optimization problem. Furthermore,
a &#8220;relaxed&#8221; threshold d*
k  &#x003E; dk  is introduced.  Once an individual violates the
relaxed threshold of one of the constraints (ck &#x003E; d*
k), death penalty (&#x03A6; = &#x221E;) is
given to it. If the individual violates one or more of the constraints (dk &#x003C; ck &#x003C; d*
k)
but none of the relaxed threshold values, its cost value &#x03A6; is penalized as follows:
                                                           35

tensity.
2.3.4   Metamodel-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (MAEA)
Due to the involvement of costly evaluation models (such as CFD software to nu-
merically predict flows in or around complex 3D geometries), solving engineering
optimization problems using EAs may become very computationally demanding.
The extensive, smart use of low-cost surrogate evaluation models (often referred to
as &#8220;metamodels&#8221;) during the optimization decreases substantially the number of
calls to the computationally expensive, problem-specific evaluation code (CFD).
This makes EAs a viable tool that can routinely be used to solve large-scale in-
dustrial optimization problems, in affordable wall clock time. Literature surveys
on the use of metamodels within EAs can be found in papers (50, 52, 73, 102) or
books (116).
   Polynomial regression, artificial neural networks, Gaussian processes etc. have
all been used as metamodels.  The existing MAEAs differ since they apply dif-
ferent interactions between the metamodel and the problem-specific evaluation
models.  Hereafter, all of them will be referred to as MAEAs.  In this thesis,
on-line trained metamodels are in use (73, 75, 111).
   In on-line trained metamodels, for all but the first few generations, the meta-
models are used to pre-evaluate the current population.  Based on the outcome
of  approximate  pre-evaluations  (Inexact  Pre-Evaluations,  IPE),  the  few  most
promising individuals are identified and these solely undergo evaluation with the
problem-specific evaluation model to compute their &#8220;exact&#8221; (high-fidelity) ob-
jective function value(s), before proceeding to the next generation.  The (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)
MAEAis sketched in fig. 2.9.
Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks   In this PhD thesis, RBF networks
are used as metamodels, though the new methods proposed in the next chapters
                                      36

   phase, within the EA&#8211;based search, is described in (73, 75, 111).
        could be combined with any other type of metamodels. RBF networks are artifi-
        cial neural networks (ANNs) with three neuron layers, (input,hidden and output)
        as shown in fig.2.10 (86). Signals propagate through the network in the forward
        direction, from the input to the output layer, by performing a nonlinear mapping
        (eq.2.15) followed by a linear one. The latter is related to the weight coefficients
        wl that must be computed during the training on a number of available patterns.
        An RBF network to be used within a MAEA should have N input units, i.e.
        as many as the design variables.  The hidden layer includes L nodes, associated
        with the so&#8211;called RBF centers cl. At each hidden neuron, a nonlinear mapping
        of the input signals to a single value is carried out using the radial-basis activa-
        tion function G : &#x211C;N  &#x2192;&#x211C;, acting on the distance of input &#x20D7; x (eq.2.15) from the
        corresponding center &#x20D7; cl &#x2208;&#x211C;N. In the current thesis, the Gaussian activation:
                                    G(u,r) = exp(-u2
  r2  )                          (2.15)
        where u = &#x2225;x-cl&#x2225;
2 the distance from the corresponding lth RBF center, is used.
           The radii or widths r values may considerably affect the prediction abilities of
        the network; these are computed using heuristics (86). The output layer includes
        as many nodes as the expected responses of the network. The single response we

are dealing with is expressed by the sum of the weighted output signals from the
hidden neurons, as follows:
                        f(x) =  K &#x2211;
 1   wi * G(u(xi),r)                      (2.16)
   If the number of hidden nodes (K) is equal to the number of training patterns
(T), the choice of the RBF centers is straightforward, i.e.  &#x20D7; c(t) &#x2261;&#x20D7; x(t), t &#x2208; [1,T],
ensuring that the T samples are exactly interpolated.  In this case, the network
training is reduced to the solution of a T&#x00D7;T symmetric linear system of equations,
as follows:                 
T
                         &#x2211;
                          t=1 wtG(&#x2225;&#x20D7;x(t) -&#x20D7; c(t)&#x2225;
2) = &#x03B6;(t)
   A common way to increase the network&#8217;s generalization (154, 177, 178) is by
using a smaller number of, appropriately selected, hidden nodes than the training
patterns, i.e.  selecting K &#x003C;T.  In this case, the selection of the RBF centers is
not straightforward, as in the aforementioned case, and is of great importance
since it strongly affects the prediction ability of the network. In (111), a selection
scheme for the RBF centers based on self-organizing maps (SOMs, (65, 85))
was proposed.  This practically comprises a two level learning scheme, namely
the unsupervised and the supervised ones.  During the unsupervised learning,
SOMs (through their standard processes: competition, cooperation and adapta-
tion) classify the training patterns into K clusters.  Each cluster gives a single
                                      38

        RBF center &#x20D7; c(k), considered to be representative of the cluster as a hole. The cor-
        responding radius rk is computed using heuristics based on distances between the
        centers, (17, 85, 111, 114). During the supervised learning, the synaptic weights
        are computed by minimizing the approximation error of the RBF network over
        the training set, while considering smoothness requirements.
           The so&#8211;called Importance Factors (IFs), as proposed by Giotis A.P et al.
        in (75), can improve the prediction ability of the RBF network.  Incorporating
        N extra coefficients (In,n = 1,N), the importance of each design parameter on
        the network response is quantified and exploited in order to increase the overall
        RBFn prediction quality. High In values indicate high sensitivity of the objective
        function in the vicinity of the design point under consideration with respect to the
        n-th input variable. The IFs are computed by the RBF network as a by-product
        of the training process and are used to improve the quality of the networks&#8217;
        output. In detail, each time an improved solution is computed by the EA (index
        b, which stands for the current best), a local RBF network is built and N partial
        derivatives &#x2202;o(b)&#x2215;&#x2202;x
n are computed using the network&#8217;s closed-form expressions;
        by  doing  so,  &#x2202;o(b)&#x2215;&#x2202;x
n  are  the  exact  derivatives  of  an  approximate  function.
        Based on these derivatives, a weighted norm is introduced and used instead of

2.3.4.1   Inexact Pre&#8211;Evaluation algorithm
The algorithm starts as a conventional (&#x03BC;,&#x03BB;)EA (by, exclusively, making use of
the exact evaluation model) for the few starting generations until a user&#8211;defined
minimum number of previously evaluated individuals enter the DB.  Then, the
IPE phase starts and, in subsequent generations, instead of evaluating the off-
spring population on the costly, problem&#8211;specific model, the following actions are
taken:

      CPU cost of each generation.
2.3.5   Hierarchical Evolutionary Algorithms
As mentioned in section 2.1, an additional way to reduce the optimization turn-
around time is by using the so-called hierarchical EA (HEA). HEAs are based on
a hierarchical search structure, which consists of a number of semi&#8211;autonomously
&#8220;evolving&#8221; levels (multilevel structure).  Within each level, different evaluation
tools, search techniques and/or problem parameterizations can be used, (39, 76,
87, 105, 106, 107, 109, 113, 171). Each level solves a different variant of the same
problem. Furthermore, adjacent levels may exchange their best individuals using
one- or two-way inter-level communications.   The following three hierarchical
schemes/modes, schematically presented in figure 2.11, can also be combined in
a single scheme.

           The three hierarchical schemes are listed below:
(a) Hierarchical Evaluation Scheme   The hierarchical evaluation scheme
allows the exploitation of the availability of a number of different evaluation
tools/softwares with different fidelity and cost (computational and/or econom-
ical).  Each tool is assigned to a separate EA level.  By convention, the lower
level undertakes the exploration of the design space by utilizing the low-cost
and reduced fidelity tool so as to locate near&#8211;optimal solutions at low CPU cost
and delivering them to the higher level(s) for further refinement.  On the higher
level(s), being exploitation oriented and responsible for delivering optimal solu-
tion(s), evaluation tools of higher fidelity and CPU cost are employed. Two&#8211;way
inter&#8211;level communication can be used providing the opportunity (apart from the
migration of promising individuals upwards so as to undergo refinement) for indi-
viduals of higher levels to move downwards so as to stimulate a more exhaustive
search in their neighborhood, based on a low cost evaluation tool. Regarding the
hierarchical evaluation scheme, as many DBs as the number of evaluation tools
should be maintained.  In a two&#8211;level algorithm, for instance, the high fidelity
DB, recording entries from evaluations based on the high level problem&#8211;specific
tool, is linked to the high level and the associated IPE phase.  Next to it, a low
fidelity DB will act similarly on the low level. Without loss in generality, differ-
ent configured MAEAs can be used on each level. An example of the hierarchical
evaluation scheme, as it is used for an industrial application, is presented in figure
2.12. Here the higher level is assosiated with a Navier-Stokes solver and the lower
level with an Euler one.
(b) Hierarchical Search Scheme   Regarding the hierarchical search scheme,
each level utilizes a different search technique, thus creating the ability to com-
bine the advantages of EAs with other type of search method.  In the case that
gradient information is available, the combination of EAs with gradient&#8211;based
methods (GBM) is of great interest.  Stochastic methods, such as EAs (DEAs,
DMAEAs, etc.), are typically used for the exploration of the design space, on
the lower level, exploiting their ability to escape local optima.  The promising
solutions are, then, migrated from low to high level which could utilize a GBM to
                                                           41

  cal metamodel-assisted EA). The high level is associated with the expensive and

  evaluation with the receiving levels evaluation tool. Right: Example of a HMAEA

efficiently, with minimum turn-around time, locate the exact optimum. The mi-
gration of promising solutions an be bi-directional to accentuate the exploration
capabilities of low level EAs.  The opposite configuration (GBM on the low and
EA on the high level) is also possible.  Hierarchical search requires particular
attention if a GBM is employed to solve MOO problems, seeking for the front
of non&#8211;dominated solutions.  A common practice is to act on a fitness function
formed by concatenating weighted objectives, which is appropriate only for con-
vex fronts. Alternatively, as proposed in (105), the GBM can optimize the same
scalar cost function (&#x03A6;) used by the EA, computed, for instance via the SPEA2
technique, after appropriately approximating the non-differentiable functions in
use.  Should a GBM undergoes the refinement on any level, methods for com-
puting the gradient of the objective function must be available. In aerodynamic
optimization, the computation of the gradient, at extra cost approximately equal
to that of solving the flow equations, can be based on the adjoint method (148).

        (c) Hierarchical Parameterization Scheme   In hierarchical parameteriza-
tion different parameterizations are associated with each level. Typically a rough
prameterization with reduced number of design variables is associated with the
lower level, where rough designs are quickly detected due to the small dimension-
ality of the problem. On the other hand, a detailed parameterization is associated
with the higher level, where realignment takes place.  The hierarchical or mul-
tilevel parameterization scheme should be configured in a way that makes, all
but the high level not affected (or, at least, slightly affected) by the curse of
dimensionality. During the inter-level migration steps, a few promising solutions
detected on the low level(s) are sent to the higher level(s) for refinement.  This
hierarchical scheme is suitable for shape optimization problems in which the de-
sign vector stands for the coordinates of control points of parametric curves and
surfaces since, increasing or decreasing the number of control points via knot
insertion and removal algorithms, allows exact (upwards) or approximate (down-
wards) transformations of the design vectors.

Knowledge Based Design
Regarding real industrial designs, it is common for a company to keep an archive
containing previous successful designs. As a consequence, and irrespective of the
design method adopted, there are good reason for new designs to be based &#8220;sim-
ilar&#8221; previous ones instead of starting the design procedure from scratch.  As a
matter of example, an archived &#8220;similar&#8221; design may, for instance when design-
ing a new turbomachinery rotor, be an archived rotor successfully designed in
the past for &#8220;slightly&#8221; different operating conditions and/or &#8220;slightly&#8221; different
objectives. In some cases, these designs might have been performed enough time
ago, using &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; design procedures and/or utilizing different pareme-
terization.  This practise can be classified as a knowledge-based system (KBS)
(4) in the sense that it utilises stored-archived knowledge, in the form of archived
successful designs, and uses it to efficiently perform future designs.
     In this thesis, a new design method, that will be referred to as Knowledge
Based Design (KBD), that combines EAs with Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS)
in order to create an automated design procedure is proposed. This methodology
employs a KBS similar to Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) (23, 97, 98, 166) in order
to utilise/exploit the availability an archive with successful designs. In the design
of aero- or hydrodynamic shapes, a pattern of similar geometries often occurs
when dealing with similar problems. For example, the optimal airfoil, regarding
objective(s) &#8220;A&#8221; and constraint(s) &#8220;B&#8221;, of a compressor cascade operating at con-
ditions &#8220;C&#8221; and inlet flow angle 40o will be, more or less, similar to the airfoil of a
different compressor designed for the same &#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8221; and inlet flow angle
                                                           45                                                   

                    DRAFT                                              3. Knowledge Based Design_______________________________________________________________________________
equal to 41o. Therefore, if a design is optimal for a set of different/neighbouring
conditions, it still holds valuable information about the design space that can be
exploited in order to speed-up the design procedure. This is the main purpose of
the proposed KBD method.  The proposed KBD method is an upgrade of both
EAs and KBS in the sense that it combines the advantages of both.
   In more detail, from the CBR point of view the proposed methodology achieves
in creating a fully automated and time efficient revise step, this is the step that
adapts the existing &#8220;similar&#8221; designs so as to make them perform optimally at
the new operating conditions and/or according to the new objectives.  In this
thesis this is achieved by using an EA as a revise tool.  In order to have a time-
efficient procedure, acceptable for use in an industrial environment, a number
of additional EA speed-up techniques, mainly the use of metamodels (MAEA,
section.2.3.4), are employed.  The straightforward way to achieve this would be
to simply inject the &#8220;similar&#8221; archived designs in the initial population of an EA,
by replacing some of the randomly generated ones.
   The method proposed in this thesis though, utilizes statistical analysis meth-
ods to introduce a new set of design variables, based on the archived designs, in
order to further speed-up the EA itself by:
a) The significant reduction in the problem dimension (i.e. the number of design
      variables handled by the EA), thus improving both EA efficiency (faster
      convergence to the optimal solution) and MAEA efficiency (use of ANNs
      as metamodels with greater prediction accuracy and without delaying the
      start of the IPE phase (see. 2.3.4)).
b) The automatic definition of the newly introduced design variables (to be re-
      ferred to as optimization variables to distinguish them from the design vari-
      ables used to paremeterize the geometry) range; the designer, thus, over-
      comes the burden of arbitrarily guessing them and, therefore, eliminates
      the possibility of excluding the values that correspond to the optimal de-
      sign from the arbitrary selected space.
c) The association of importance to the optimization space regions. Practically,
      higher probability to host candidate solutions is given to the regions of the
                                      46

              design space pinpointed by the statistical analysis of the archived &#8220;similar&#8221;
              designs based on a pre-defined probability distribution.  This allows the
              exploration of grated design spaces but with different levels of importance
              for their subregions according to statistics.
3.1    Knowledge-based Systems (KBS)
Knowledge-based systems (KBS) (4) are systems based on the methods and tech-
niques of artificial intelligence.  Their core components are the knowledge base
and inference mechanisms.  In this thesis, a KBS, named Case-Based Reason-
ing (CBR) (97) is modified and combined with EAs, in an optimal way, giving
rise to the newly proposed KBD method.  Furthermore, for reason of clarity, a
brief presentation of the CBR method follows before the presentation of the KBD
method.
3.1.1   Case-Based Reasoning method
CBR (23, 97, 98, 166) can be seen as a problem solving method that reuses past
cases and experience to conceive a solution to the current problem, while other
major artificial intelligence techniques rely on mapping generalized relationships
between problem descriptions and conclusions.  CBR has the advantage of uti-
lizing previous experience based on successful old-problem solutions.  The main
tasks of a CBR system is to identify the problem in hand, find one or more similar
past case(s), use this information to suggest a solution to the current problem
and update the system by learning from this experience.
   The origins of CBR dates back to the work by Schank and Abelson in 1977
(160). They proposed that general human knowledge about situations is recorded
as scripts that allows the extract of expectations and inferences. Scripts were pro-
posed as structure for conceptual memory describing information about stereo-
typical events. However, experiments showed that they are not a complete theory
of memory representation since people often confuse events with similar scripts.
Such observations fell in line with concept formulation, problem solving and ex-
perimental learning theories within philosophy and psychology (46, 142).

   Schank continued to investigate the role of previous situations (i.e.  cases)
and situation patterns role in both problem solving and learning (159) whereas,
simultaneously, Gentner (31) developed a theoretical framework for analogy also
relevant to CBR. Significant references to CBR can also be fount in Wittgen-
steins&#8217;s observation (125) that natural concepts are in fact polymorphic and can
not be classified by a single set of necessary and sufficient features but instead
can be defined by a set of instances (i.e.  cases) with family resemblances.  The
latter work has been cited as the philosophical basis for CBR by Aamondt and
Plaza (3).
   Even though the roots of CBR could be claimed by several scientists, it was
Schank and his group that in the early eighties produced a cognitive model where
the first CBR applications were based upon.  Kolonder developed the first CBR
system named CYRUS (94, 95) which was an implementation of Schank&#8217;s dy-
namic memory model. Later its case-memory model served as the basis for several
other CBR systems finding use in various disciplines ranging from law (45, 96)
to civil engineering (92, 138).
   The classical definition of CBR was coined by Riesbeck and Schank (23): &#8221;A
case-based reasoner solves problems by using or adapting solutions to old prob-
lems&#8221;.  This clearly defines what a CBR system can do but does not determine
the way to do this.  A general answer to the latter is commonly associated with
the so-called CBR-cycle (Figure 3.1).  The CBR-cycle is based on four logical
steps, as defined by Aamodt and Plaza (3), comprising the four REs:
   &#x2219; RETRIEVE the most &#8220;similar&#8221; case(s);
   &#x2219; REUSE the retrieved case(s) for the problem in hand;
   &#x2219; REVISE the case(s), if necessary, and
   &#x2219; RETAIN the new solution in the archive for future use.
which can be represented by a schematic cycle (see Figure 3.1).
   The REVISE step is, in the proposed in the next section KBD method, re-
placed by an EA which automatically combines the RETRIEVED cases without
requiring human intervention.  Remember that the traditional CBR method re-
quires a human expert to undertake that task.

             Figure 3.1: Schematic representation of the CBR-cycle (3).
3.2    The KBD method
In order to have a fully automated REVISE step, the human intervention has
to be replaced by a set of adaptation rules.  These rules take into account the
deviations of the proposed solution compared to the desired one and suggest an
improved proposal. The rules that govern the evolution of species, ideally fit the
above description.  So, in this PhD thesis, an EA is proposed to undertake the
REVISE step.
   Therefore,  the  method  proposed  here  aims  at  extending  the  optimization
method by making it capable to accommodate and exploit pieces of useful infor-
mation archived during previous relevant successful designs.  The KBD method
is much more elaborated than the simple and straightforward injection of the the
retrieved designs in the initial population of an EA, by replacing some of the
randomly generated ones.  Instead, KBD introduces a new set of optimization
variables to be used by the EA. The so-called optimization variables are used

during the optimization instead of the design variable, which in cases of complex
3D geometries, such as those involved in the field of thermal and hydraulic turbo-
machines are grade in number and therefore slow down the design/optimization
procedure.  Using the optimization variables takes place by expressing the can-
didate solutions as points in the optimization space, which is the space created
by basis vectors which are the design vectors of the retrieved geometries.  The
role of the optimization algorithms is to find the set (or sets, for more than one
objectives, where the Pareto front of non-dominated solutions is sought) of the
optimization variables that correspond to the shape with optimal performance.
Since the number of optimization variables is much less that the number of design
variables, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced and the CPU cost of the
EA or MAEA is expected to be much lower.
3.2.1   Introducing the optimization variables.
In  this  section,  the  optimization  variables  introduced  by  the  proposed  KBD
method are presented. First, let us assume that a small number (m) of previous
designs are retrieved from the archive. These designs must correspond to similar
problems, as already discussed. For the proposed method it is necessary that the
retrieved geometries are expressed in terms of the same parameterization.  This
is always possible given that techniques, able to transform a parameterization
scheme to any other (within a degree of accuracy of course) exist. Let us denote
by GEOi = (bi
1,bi
2,....,bi
n), i=1,m the m archived designs, with bj, j = 1,N their
design variables.
   The set of optimization variables can be defined, without yet associating any
degree of importance to the optimization space subregions,  by assuming that
a new design bnew
j     may result from the combination of the m archived designs,
weighted by the wi(i = 1,m),

        around the desired one in the operating conditions space and based on the as-
        sumption that this information is, more or less, transferable to the design space,
        the use of normal probability distribution for importance assignment is taking
        place throughout this thesis.  In a simplified example, the above statement says
        that; if airfoil A, with design variables vector &#x20D7; xA, is optimal, regarding objective(s)
        &#8220;O&#8221;, when operating in conditions &#8220;C&#8221; and delivers flow turning of &#x0394;a = 40o
        and design B, &#x20D7; xB, is optimal regarding the same objectives at the same condi-
        tions and delivers flow turning of &#x0394;a = 42o; and if the design of new airfoil N
        optimal regarding &#8220;O&#8221; operating at &#8220;C&#8221; that delivers flow turning of &#x0394;a = 41o

        the retrieved archived geometries. It is reminded that, if the normal probability
        distribution is used for importance assignment, the regions near the mean value
        of each design variables, as it is computer by eq. 8.10, will be assigned the grater

importance and, therefore, the grater probability to accommodate candidate so-
lutions.  Furthermore, if the user knows, in advance, that for his problem the
above statement is not true he can freely exchange the normal distribution with
a different, appropriate, probability distribution.
   The use of the cumulative distribution function of the normal probability dis-
tribution, eq. 3.3, practically assumes the bounds of bi to be within &#x03BC;i3&#x03C3;i (131).
To overcome this limitation, a single extrapolation variable &#x03A8; which multiplies
all computed (based on the archived designs) &#x03C3; values and, thus, extends the
search space outside of &#x03BC;i  3&#x03C3;i, is optionally introduced.  &#x03A8; is multiplied with
the computed standard deviations to yield those used in eq. 3.3, as follows

   If the available archived/similar designs are not that many, which is practically
the most frequent case, then m is a significantly small integer.  With either eq.
3.1 or eq.  3.2, an optimization problem with only m weights as unknowns may
become neither effective nor flexible. Such a method may overcome the curse of
dimensionality (since the number of the optimization variables is not N) but may
lead to sub-optimal solutions. To overcome this, the grouping of design variables
that correlate with each other might be used. Correlated design variables such as,
for instance, those defining the mean camber surface angle at leading edge, etc,
are grouped together. After forming these groups, different weights are associated
with each one of them.  This is why the new weights are denoted by wi,k, where
the first index corresponds to the ith design basis and the second one to the kth
group of design variables (where bi belongs to).  Finally, instead of either eq.3.1
or eq.3.2, the following equation

        formulated.  Search methods, such as EAs (or MAEAs), with the proposed pa-

3.3    Design of a compressor cascade using KBD
The design of a 2-D compressor cascade operating at M1  = 0.54, a1  = 44o and
Re = 4&#x00D7;105 (bsaed on chord) for minimum total pressure losses is sought. Losses
are measured in terms of the total pressure loss coefficient
                               &#x03C9; = pt1 - pt2 
 pt1 - p1                               (3.7)
where the indicators 1 and 2 denote the inlet and outlet of the flow field, re-
spectively. The blade airfoil is designed subject to a number of aerodynamic and
geometrical constraints: the optimal airfoil must turn the flow by more than 30o
by ensuring that its thickness at three chord-wise positions (0.3c, 0.6c &amp; 0.9c) is
greater that (0.10c, 0.08c &amp; 0.01c), respectively.
   The airfoil shape is parameterized based on a mean-camber line and thickness
distributions scheme. Both the mean-camber line and the superimposed thickness
distributions are parameterized using NURBS. The mean-camber line is param-
eterized using three variables namely the leading edge (LE) angle, the trailing

        suction side thickness distribution is controlled via 9 design variables, namely
        the x and y positions and weights of the three, out of the five internal NURBS
        control points.  The first and last control points are fixed at the predefined LE
        and TE positions.  The pressure side thickness distribution is controlled via 15
        design variables namely the x and y position and weight of the five, out of the
        eight internal control points.  The first and last control points are fixed at the
        predefined LE and TE positions and the second point is controlled for the desire
        of 1st order continuity at the LE position. The total number of design variables
        that describe each candidate solution is 27, fig.3.4.

   of the mean-camber line with 3 control points. Bottom: the parametrization of the
   thickness distributions with NURBS having 5 control points for the suction side
   and 8 for the pressure side. The total number of design variables is 27.
           The merits of the KBD method will be examined through the comparison of a
        traditional MAEA with the KBD-MAEA. The populations for both MAEAs are
        &#x03BC; = 20, &#x03BB; = 60 and &#x03BB;e = 6. Both cases use local RBF networks as metamodels,
        which are trained on a small number of automatically selected training patterns
        (min 10;  max 20 patterns).  For KBD-MAEA the IPE phase starts after 100
        individuals are stored in the database of previously evaluated individuals. On the
        other hand, for the MAEA run, 400 individuals must be stored in the database
        before the start of the IPE phase.  The earlier start of the IPE phase during
        the KBD-MAEA as opposed to the MAEA, is a due to the reduced number
        and effective range of the optimization variables.  The KBD-MAEA uses 13 as
        opposed to the 27 design variables according to the shape parameterization. The
        evaluation software is an integral boundary layer method (43).  The maximum

number of calls to the evaluation software was set equal to 1500 in order to
compare the two algorithms based on the same CPU cost.
   Four archived designs are retrieved and used as the design space basis vectors
in order to create the optimization variables as proposed by KBD. The archived
designs have been designed for operation at different but neighbouring conditions
i.e. :
   &#x2219; Archived design B1  was designed for M1 = 0.55 and a1 = 45o, fig.3.5.
   &#x2219; Archived design B2  was designed for M1 = 0.50 and a1 = 40o, fig.3.6.
   &#x2219; Archived design B3  was designed for M1 = 0.52 and a1 = 42.5o, fig.3.7.
   &#x2219; Archived design B4  was designed for M1 = 0.58 and a1 = 48o, fig.3.8.
Operating at their design conditions the archived geometries perform as follows:
   &#x2219; Archived design B1  yields &#x03C9; = 0.01976 and &#x0394;a = 37.1o.
   &#x2219; Archived design B2  yields &#x03C9; = 0.01845 and &#x0394;a = 24.4o.
   &#x2219; Archived design B3  yields &#x03C9; = 0.02027 and &#x0394;a = 36.3o.
   &#x2219; Archived design B4  yields &#x03C9; = 0.01877 and &#x0394;a = 36.6o.
Should the four retrieved airfoils be reused in the desirable flow conditions (M1 =
0.54, a1 = 44o) their performance is:
   &#x2219; Archived design B1  yields &#x03C9; = 0.0207 and &#x0394;a = 36.3o.
   &#x2219; Archived design B2  yields &#x03C9; = 0.0278 and &#x0394;a = 27.8o.
   &#x2219; Archived design B3  yields &#x03C9; = 0.0201 and &#x0394;a = 37.5o.
   &#x2219; Archived design B4  yields &#x03C9; = 0.0237 and &#x0394;a = 33.1o.
From the aforementioned &#x03C9; and &#x0394;a values, the necessity for a revise step becomes
clear since all four retrieved airfoils suffer from relatively high losses and some of
them fail to respect the &#x0394;a constraint at the flow condition which are of interest.

These four designs were injected in the starting population of the MAEA, either

   Four different optimization procedure were performed in order to assess both
the effect of the KBD method on EAs and, also, its effect on the implementation
of metamodels in MAEAs. The corresponding convergence plots are summarized
in fig 3.11.  The use of metamodels in the non-KBD runs are cannot give the
otherwise expected gain in performance. This is a result of the large design space
that comes out of the necessity to reproduce the four archived geometries.  To
demonstrate this, the four archived geometries are plotted together in figures 3.9

        design space would help both the EA efficiency and the additional gain from the
        use of metamodels (MAEA) but could result in suboptimal solutions if, by chance,
        the optimal geometry could lay outside of the smaller design space.  The com-
        parison between EA and KBD-EA shows the advantages of the proposed method
        (fig. 3.11), since faster convergence is achieved. Furthermore, the comparison of
        KBD-MAEA with KBD-EA shows that, using the KBD method results is a much
        better performance of the metamodels.
                                                                                            
   Figure 3.11: Design of a compressor cascade using KBD: Convergence comparison
   of four optimization runs, EA, KBD-EA, MAEA and KBD-MAEA. EA and MAEA
   have similar convergence plots, since the use of metamodels cannot not yield the
   expected gain, likely due to the extended range of the design variables.  KBD-EA
   is significantly faster than both EA and MAEA, thus proving the merits of the
   proposed method.  Furthermore, KBD-MAEA yields additional gain proving the
   positive effect that the proposed method on the use of metamodels.
           The optimal blade resulting from KBD-MAEA is presented in fig. 3.12. The
        design delivers &#x03C9; = 0.01834 and &#x0394;a = 30.2o at the desirable operating conditions.
        The design is better than all basis designs (operating at the desirable conditions)
        and respects all the constraints.   The airfoil designed using the KBD-MAEA

EAs and MAEAs assisted by
Principal Component Analysis
This chapter investigates the reasons for efficiency degradation of EAs or MAEAs
used to solve ill-posed optimization problems (71, 164, 167) and proposes tech-
niques to avoid it. Any deterioration in the EA or MAEA efficiency reflects upon
the number of evaluations (on the CFD software, for instance) required to reach
the optimal solution(s). Increasing the number of evaluations leads to longer op-
timization turn around rimes and this seriously hinders the routine application
of EA-based optimization for large-scale industrial applications.  The proposed
methods can be used either with EAs (by adapting the application of the evolu-
tion operators accordingly) or MAEAs (by training more dependable metamodels
on patterns of properly reduced dimension). Regarding MAEAs, it is evident that
both methods can optimally be combined, aiming at even better efficiency.
     Modern industrial-scale optimization problems typically have several objec-
tives and/or constraints and a complex parameterization, with great number N
of design variables. The former is determined by the application under consider-
ation whereas the latter could be &#8220;inherited&#8221; from the way experienced designers
used to accomplish the same task in the past, without resorting to &#8220;sophisticated&#8221;
optimization methods.  From the practical point of view, a smooth transition to
the EA-based optimization is necessary. Problems with enough objectives and/or
constraints and, practically, a great number N can easily become ill-posed as dis-
cussed in section 4.1. Since the objectives and the constraints are strictly defined
                                                           61

by the application, remedies to the ill-posedness of the optimization problem must
rely on the smart handling of the parameterization alone.
   Changing the parameterization, though, may have a number of negative ef-
fects. First among them is that, in any industrial environment, a valuable amount
of experience is embodied into the existing parameterization, in the sense that
an experienced designer practically knows exactly what to change in order to
achieve a given goal; this will be lost by altering the paremeterization scheme.
On top of that there is no guarantee that the parameterization which must be
build in correlation with the objectives so as to give a well-posed optimization
problem, includes design variables with a clear meaning (being, for instance, the
coordinates of Bezier control points etc.), in fact is highly unlikeable. The new pa-
rameterization, lacking a clear interpretation of the design variables, will make it
even more difficult for new experience to be accumulated based upon it. Further-
more, for a specific project, the best parameterization depends on its correlation
with the corresponding objectives and constraints. Therefore, a different param-
eterization would be necessary for any new design-optimization procedure, based
on its objectives.  To make things even worse the best parameterization cannot
be known in advance, since one should have the Pareto front available in order
to know the shape of the scalar cost function in the design space and use it for
extracting the most appropriate parameterization.  All the above are overcome
by implementing the techniques proposed in this chapter.
   The fact that a standard GA can find the global optimum of a number of
widely used in literature test functions was not due to the efficiency of the re-
combination operator and the regular distribution of local minima, but because
the optimization was decomposable into n independent one-dimensional subprob-
lemd was presented in (167).  Although this study was made regarding GA, its
outcomes can be generalized for the entire EA family.   In (164, 165),  it was
stated that &#8220;real-life&#8221; engineering design optimisation problems, as opposed to
the widely used mathematical test cases, suffer, among multiple objectives, con-
straints and qualitative issues, also involve interaction among design variables.
Thus the notions of &#8220;Inseparable Function Interaction&#8221; and &#8220;Variable Depen-
dence&#8221; were introduced. These variable dependence pose a number of challenges
for multiobjective optimisation algorithms since the design variables cannot be

        varied independently of each other.   Also,  as it is stated in (165),  depending
        upon the nature of variable dependency, additional features (such as bias (non-
        linearity), multi-modality, deception and discontinuity) may also be introduced
        in the problem and cause efficiency degradation of the optimization algorithm.
        Additionally stating that &#8220;There is currently a lack of systematic research in the
        field of variable dependence&#8221;. This Thesis comes to fill this gap.
4.1    Ill-posed optimization problems
The two main reasons for increasing the number of calls to the evaluation software
required by an EA or MAEA in order to locate the optimal solution(s) are; a) the
high number of design variables, N &#x003E;&#x003E; and b) the fact that an ill-posed optimiza-
tion problem is to be solved.  Needless to say that a high-dimensional ill-posed
optimization problem is the worst case for an EA or MAEA. Unfortunately, in
practice, most engineering optimization problems share both the aforementioned
features.
   The high number of design variables (N) in EAs causes efficiency deteriora-
tion, since it increases computational cost, in the best case (well-posed problem)
linearly with N. In MAEAs, the presence of N &#x003E;&#x003E; design variables, apart from
the way the optimal solution is approached (direct effect), also affects the use of
metamodels for which both the training time and prediction error increase no-
ticeably. The loss in efficiency due to the &#8220;less-accurate&#8221; metamodel predictions
(indirect effect) is, practically, superimposed to the performance degradation due
to the slow evolution.  As a remedy to the class of optimization problems with
N &#x003E;&#x003E;, a method (abbreviated to KBD) that reduces, to a certain degree, the
problem dimension by exploiting the knowledge embodied into a small number of
available archived designs has already been presented and validated in chapter 3.
   On the other hand, ill-posed optimization problems are those dealing with; a)
anisotropic and b) non-separable objective function f. Let us note that the former
is a prerequisite for the latter.  The definitions of anisotropic and non-separable
functions f follow in section 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 respectively.  Ill-posed problems in
combination with N &#x003E;&#x003E; give rise to the so called &#8220;curse of dimensionality&#8221;. The
&#8220;curse of dimensionality&#8221; stands for the situation in which the cost for solving
                                                           63

the optimization problem to increases, no more linearly but, superlinearly with
N.
4.1.1   Anisotropic objective function
Objective function f(&#x20D7;x), &#x20D7; x = (x1,...,xN) is anisotropic with respect to &#x20D7; x if this is
differently affected by the same changes in the different components of &#x20D7; x. Though,
in this thesis, we are dealing with non-gradient-based optimization methods, the
anisotropy of f can be quantified by the variation in  &#x2202;f _
&#x2202;xi  close to the optimal
solution.
   For instance for the convex-quadratic function;
                              f(&#x20D7;x) = 1 
2&#x20D7; xT H&#x20D7;x                             (4.1)
where H is a symmetric positive definite N &#x00D7; N matrix.
   The variation in &#x2202;f _
&#x2202;xi  for the equation 4.1 is quantified via the condition number
(a) of the Hessian matrix (H). Where the condition number (a) of H is defined
as the ratio between its largest and smallest eigenvalue.   The aforementioned
eigenvalues correspond to the squared relative lengths of the principal axes of
the ellipsoid &#x20D7; xT H&#x20D7;x = 1.  For points located on the principal axes, the gradient
aligns with the corresponding axis direction, and the axis length determines the
magnitude of movement required to achieve a certain change in f.  Therefore f,
is said to be isotropic if the condition number of H is a = 1 (corresponding to a
sphere or hyper-sphere, see figure 4.1) and anisotropic is a &#x003E;&#x003E;&#x003E; 1 (corresponding
to a ellipse, see figure 4.1).
   In practice, EAs are capable of efficiently dealing with anisotropic objective
functions without damaging their efficiency. If, however, the objective function is
anisotropic and non-separable (see definition in section 4.1.2), the EA or MAEA
is expected to worsen its efficiency, unless a particular treatment is employed;
such a treatment is proposed in this thesis.
   Furthermore, the anisotropy of f leads to the notion of more and less important
design variables (or,  in the case of non-separable f,  more and less important
directions in the design space).  This piece of information can be used to reduce
N, via truncation of the less important variables, either during the optimization

        procedure (which is not the case in this thesis and could be a proposal for future
        work) or during the metamodel training phase so as to increase its prediction
        ability.
4.1.2   Non-separabile objective function
Separability of an objective function f : &#x20D7; x &#x21A6;&#x2192; f(&#x20D7;x) is a condition characterizing
separately for each and every variable xi  &#x2208; &#x20D7; x.  An objective function is said to
be separable with respect to xi if the optimal value of xi does not depend on the
value any other design variable takes on.  A function f is said to be separable if
and only if it is separable with respect to all components of &#x20D7; x.
   As mentioned above an ill-posed optimization problem suffers from the curse
of dimensionality, the computational cost to solve it scales superlinearly with the
number of design variables (N). This results from the presence of a non-separable
objective function (which is possible due to the anisotropy of f). To understand
this, let us first examine a separable objective function.  The cost for solving an
optimization problem with a separable objective function increases linearly with
N, since the global optimum could be located by minimizing N objective functions
                                                           65

with a single design variable each (separately minimise fi(xi), &#x2200;xi &#x2208; &#x20D7; x). Thus, the
cost to solve a separable N-dimensional optimization problem is approximately
N times the cost to solve the equivalent 1D optimization problem. On the other
hand,  this is not possible for an ill-posed optimization problem,  since,  for at
least one design variable, its optimal value depends on the value that the rest
take.  Furthermore, regarding the ill-posed problem, the search space increases
exponentially with N and therefore the cost of solving the ill-posed optimization
problem increases superlinearly with N.
4.1.3   Investigation of ill-posed optimization problems on
         EA efficiency
In order to Investigate the effects of ill-posed optimization problems on EA ef-
ficiency two analytical test cases have been solved, for a range of design space
dimensions, both in their separable (well-posed) and non-separable (ill-posed)
form.  All the result that will be presented furthermore during this section are
concerning the mean values over 10 runs that took place with different random
number generator seeds.
   The first analytical test case to me examined is a multidimensional ellipsoid
(a 2d version of it can be seen in fig. 4.2) described, in it separable form, by:
                                      66

 i=1  = a i-1
n-1 x2i                           (4.2)
        where a is the so called condition number which quantifies the anisotropy of the
        objective function as described above.   Large values of a lead to increasingly
        anisotropic objective functions.
           and in its non-separable form by:
                                   f(&#x20D7;x) =  n &#x2211;
 i=1  = a i-1
n-1 y2i                           (4.3)
        where &#x20D7; y = B&#x20D7;x and B a n &#x00D7; n orthogonal, rotation, matrix.
           In order to investigate both the effects of the design space dimension (N)
        and the condition number (a) four different optimization problems will be solved.
        A ten dimensional (N = 10) optimizations problem is solved for a = 10 and
        a = 100, see fig.  4.3, and a n = 30 problem is solved for a = 100 and a = 1000,
        see fig. 4.4.

   Condition number (a =  100).   Increasing of a for 10 to 100 causes additional
   losses and increases the performance gap between separable and non-separable
   optimization problem.
           Observing figures 4.3 and 4.4 one can identify both the effects of increased
        condition number and dimension. Bigger condition number leads to greater per-
                                                           67

formance gab between separable and non-separable cases, for both the N = 10
and N = 30 cases.  Bigger dimension also increases the gab between the two.
Focusing  on  the  a =  100  case  for  both  the  N  =  10  and  N  =  30  example
once can observe that the difference of objective function values &#x0394;(F), for the
same  computational  cost  of  9000  evaluations,  differ.   For  the  N  =  10  case
&#x0394;(F) = F(non - separable) - F(separable) &#x2248; 1e-4  on the other hand for the
n = 30 case &#x0394;(F) = F(non - separable) - F(separable) &#x2248; 0.9.  This difference
of &#x0394;(F) for the 10D and 30D case denotes a significant increase of the efficiency
gab between separable and non-separable cases when the dimension is increased.
   The second analytical test case to be examined here is a multidimensional
multi-modal objective function described by:
             f(&#x20D7;x) = 10 * n + (  n&#x2211;
 i=1 xi)2 - 10 * n * cos(&#x03C0; * n &#x2211;
 i=1 xi)            (4.4)
   A two dimentional example of it can be found in fig. 4.5. The above problem,
in the eq. 4.4 form, is non-separable as shown in fig. 4.5. It can though easily be
transformed to a separable one if &#x20D7; x is transformed into &#x20D7; y through the operation
&#x20D7;y = B&#x20D7;x where B the appropriate rotation matrix (45o  rotation &#x2200; directions).
This objective function can also be classified as extremely anisotropic since only
                                      68

        one of the separable directions has contribution in the objective faction value
        and all the rest became irrelevant therefore a equals practically to &#x221E;.  This is
        an important class of objective functions since it resembles MOO problems as we
        will see further on (section 4.2).

        lems dimension two optimization problems where solved a 5 and a 30 dimensional
        one.
                                                                           
   Figure 4.5:  Minimization of eq.  4.4, with two degrees of freedom.  The optimal
   value of x1 depends on the choice of x2 and vice-versa thus this objective function
   is non-separable. Nevertheless, if one of the two design variables was aligned to the
   x1 = x2 axis, the problem becomes separable.
           Observing figure 4.6 one can notice that both for the 5D and 30D problems,
        the case with separable objective function outperforms the case with the non-
        separable one. Furthermore one may observe that the increased dimension caused
        an increase in the efficiency gain, between separable and non-separable function
        cases. This conclusion is similar to the one made for the ellispoid test case.

  Figure 4.6:  Left:  5 dimensional optimization problem eq.4.4.  Right:  30 dimen-
  sional optimization problem eq.4.4.  The amount of efficiency losses in problems
  with extremely anisotropic objective functions increases significantly with the di-
  mension of the design space.
   Through the preformed investigations (figs. 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6) it is proven that
a significant amount of EA effitiency can be lost when they are dealing with ill-
posed optimization problems. The severity of efficiency deterioration is analogous
to three main quantities;
a) The anisotropy magnitude.  Increasing anisotropy increases loss of EA effi-
      ciency (fig. 4.3 and 4.4).
b) Function separability.  Optimization problems with objective functions sepa-
      rable with respect to their design variables can be solved significantly faster
      using EAs, as it is shown in figs. 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6.
c) The number of design variables N. Though it is obvious that by increasing the
      number of design variables any EA requires more computational resources
      to locate the optimal solution. Additionally, if combined with b), the great
      value of N van lead to the so-called curse of dimensionality (fig. 4.6).
4.2    Ill-posed MOO problems
Regarding ill-posed MOO problems one should observe the shape of the scalar
cost function &#x03A6;, since &#x03A6; is the quantity that drives the evolution operators, and
not each and every objective function separately. In MOO, ill-posed optimization

        is sought. If the &#x03A6; assignment technique is based on Pareto dominance all mem-
        bers of the current front of non-dominated solutions have &#x03A6; = 0 (or very small
        values compared to the dominated members of the population).
4.3    Improved Parameterization
The aim is to find the appropriate linear orthogonal transformation of the origi-
nal set of design variables &#x20D7; x &#x2192; &#x20D7; x* which will transform the ill-posed optimization
problem in hand into a well-posed one.  In specific after this transformation the
objective function (SOO) or &#x03A6; (MOO) is expected to has enhanced separability
with respect to the transformed design variables &#x20D7; x*.  This procedure is equiva-
lent to finding an orthogonal matrix U (UUT  = I) and express the transformed
&#x20D7;x* = UT&#x20D7; x.  The latter equation stands for a simple coordinate system rotation
where that the new basis is the &#x20D7; x*.  In this thesis, it is said that the topological
characteristics of the Pareto front indicate the appropriate transformation ma-
trix U.  To extract the topological characteristics of the Pareto front in a way
which best represents the data variance, principal component analysis (PCA) is
used ,(86, 103).  Therefore, the transformation matrix U is said to be the ma-
trix which contains the Principal Directions (PDs) as they were computed by the
PCA applied on the members of the Pareto front.
   As shown earlier in this chapter,  switching form &#x20D7; x to &#x20D7; x* and by applying
the evolution operators on that, can lead to a significantly faster exploration of
the design space.  However, this requires the knowledge of the Pareto front, the
finding of which is the final goal of the optimization process.  Instead, in each
EA generation, the front of non-dominates solutions (elite-set) can be used for
the PCA. This is a reasonable choice since, as the evolution proceeds, the current
elite-set tents to the Pareto front. Thus, PDs computed based on the elite-set are,
increasingly reliable, approximations of the PDs computed based on the Pareto
front.
   Applying PCA to the current elite-set first demands the transformation of its
members into a standardized data-set (X) with &#x03BC; = 0 and &#x03C3; = 1 in all directions.

Next step is the empirical covariance matrix P, (55, 103) computation,

eXXT                           (4.5)
   where e is the size of the elite set and X the matrix which contains the mem-
bers of the elite-set as columns.  Then via the spectral decomposition theorem,
(16, 55), P can be written as
                                PN&#x00D7;N = U&#x039B;UT                           (4.6)
where &#x039B; = diag(&#x03BB;1,...,&#x03BB;N) is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of P and
U is a N&#x00D7;N matrix formed containing the eigenvectors (PDs) as columns.
   In industrial scale optimization problems, such as the ones this thesis is dealing
with, where the evaluation of a candidate solution may cost from minutes up
to even hours on a multiprocessor system,  the additional computational cost
attributed to the PCA computation is, practically, negligible.
   The most efficient method to perform PCA is by means of the so-called singu-
lar value decomposition (SVD), (157), which allows the matrix X to be expressed
as
                                  X = U&#x039B;V T                             (4.7)
   where, V T  a matrix containing the eigenvectors of XT X.
   In industrial scale optimization problems, such as the ones concerning this the-
sis, where a design evaluation requires time of the order of minutes or even hours,
the portion of the total computational cost attributable to PCA computation is
negligible.
   To better demonstrate the variable correlation estimation in MOO problems
the welded beam test case is used (fig.  4.7).  The minimization of both the cost
(K) and the deflection (&#x0394;) of a welded beam subject to a force P  (fig.  4.7)
is desired.   There are two design variables:  the welding length (X1) and the
side length of the square cross section (X2) (fig.  4.7).  The design is subject to
constraints of shear stress (&#x03C4;), bending stress (&#x03C3;) and buckling load (Pc).
   The problem is formulated formulated as,

           Observing the shape of &#x03A6; in figure 4.9-left it is evident that the problem in

        proposed in this PhD thesis, variable correlation estimation procedure via apply-
        ing PCA on the elite-set (fig. 4.9 -right) it is obvious that the principal directions,
        as they are computed from PCA, are pointing out the separable directions in the
        design space.  The direction with the biggest eigenvalue e1  is the direction that
        describes the Pareto front, walks along &#x03A6; = 0.  On the other hand the principal
        direction with the smallest eigenvalue e2 is the direction in the design space that
        yields the biggest change in &#x03A6; values.  Smaller eigenvalue means smaller vari-
        ance in this direction thus the EA, through its evolution operators, restricted the
        values of this direction within a small band of values denoting the importance
        regarding &#x03A6; for the this direction.

   Looking at the physical meaning of the correlations between the design vari-
ables in the welded beam case; e1  suggest that if one desires to move along the
&#x03A6; = 0 front he should either increase X1 (welding length) and decrease X2 (cross
section) or vise vesra. In other words one can move from, say, expensive designs
with small deflection to cheap designs with bigger deflection (fig.4.10) by reduc-
ing the cross section but in order to keep respecting the various stress constraints
(fig.4.8) one should simultaneously increase the welding length.  On the other
hand e2  suggest that if one wants to move on the direction that would cause
the biggest difference in &#x03A6; he should either increase or decrease both X1 &amp; X2
simultaneously.

        4.4   PCA-driven evolution operators
In EA-based optimization the application of the evolution operators may benefit
a lot from the outcome of the PCA, so as to lead to lower computational cost
for the same quality of solutions.  To be more specific, PCA is used to identify
the directions in the design space that, if used as optimization variables, would
lead to an optimization problem with separable objective function.  The design
space is, then, temporarily aligned with the principal directions and the evolution
operators apply to the so&#8211;rotated space and, finally, the generated offspring are
transformed back to the original design space.  The rotation of the design space
occurs just before and after the application of the evolution operators and could be
combined with truncation, i.e. dimentionality reduction, although this is beyond
the scope of this thesis. To perform PCA, a small number of representative solu-
tions to the problem must be available, herein this are the member of the current
elite set; this set is dynamically updated during the evolution. In MOO applica-
tions, the elite set comprises the members of the current front of non&#8211;dominated
solutions. In SOO problems, in which there is no set of non&#8211;dominated solutions,
the principal components can be found by processing a user&#8211;defined number of
top individuals in the current offspring population.  It is evident that, as the
evolution proceeds, and the current front of non&#8211;dominated solutions converges
to the Pareto front, the principal components approach those of the Pareto front.
     Let the aligned with the principal components design vectors &#x20D7; xi be represented
by &#x20D7; x*
i . The alignment is performed as follows 
                                          &#x20D7; x*
i  = U(&#x20D7;xi - &#x03BC;X)                                  (4.15)
where &#x03BC;X  is the vector of mean (over the elite set) design variables. The inverse
transformation, from &#x20D7; x*
i  to &#x20D7; xi, is given by 
                                         &#x20D7; xi = U-1&#x20D7; x*
i + &#x03BC;X                                        (4.16)
It is important to note that the CPU cost to compute U-1  is negligible since U
is an orthogonal matrix and, thus, U-1 = UT .

   The two main PCA driven evolution operators, recombination and mutation,
are presented below.
4.4.1   PCA driven recombination
In PCA driven recombination, the recombination operator is applied on a contin-
uously updated design space which is sought to be as separable as possible. This,
as can be seen in fig.4.11, changes the probability of the offspring appearance
on the design space in a way that yields higher probability to individuals that
respect the aforementioned correlations between the design variables (fig.4.9).
                                                                                         
  Figure 4.11: Offspring appearance probability of the welded beam case, parents
  are the tow black dots.  Left:  SBX recombination (section 2.3.1.1).  Right:  PCA
  driven SBX recombination. The variable correlations (separable directions) for the
  welded beam case are shown in fig.4.9.
   Observing fig.4.9 together with fig.4.11, it is evident that the proposed method
assigns higher probability to the regions near &#x03A6; = 0 which is the region that
accommodates the currently best (elite) individuals.  Therefore PCA-driven re-
combination better achieves its goal of mixing according to the building block
hypothesis (80).  Mixing is the process where recombination combines building
blocks (low order schemata of high fitness) to form new potentially fit schemata
of higher order.  The proposed method, simply, increases the probability of the
resulting from recombination individuals to be fit.

        4.4.2   PCA driven mutation
Mutation is also applied on the aligned with principal directions design space.
Furthermore the mutation probability on each principal direction is dynamically
updated based on the variance (&#x20D7;V ) among the members of the elite population
on the aforementioned direction (V (i)) eq.4.17. This is done in such a way that
overall mutation probability per individual is kept constant (and equal to a user
defined value) but the way the mutation probability is distributed among the
design variable (or, to be more precise, the direction in the design space) is anal-
ogous to their importance regarding &#x03A6;. As shown through the welded beam case,
the importance of each principal direction regarding &#x03A6; is inversely proportional to
its eigenvalue/variance therefore the principal direction with higher eigenvalues
receive a smaller portion of the overall mutation probability as opposing to the
directions with lower eigenvalues that receive a bigger portion of it.

     The PCA&#8211;driven MAEA or MAEA(PCA) (fig.4.12) algorithm is presented
below. Let us denote the generation counter by g, the number of current entries
into the DB by kDB  and the minimum number of entries needed to initiate the
use of the metamodel&#8211;based pre&#8211;evaluation phase by kmin.  Then, the steps of
the PCA&#8211;driven MAEA can be described as follows:
Step 1: For the current offspring population Sg
&#x03BB;, set &#x03BB;* = &#x03BB; (if k
DB &#x003C; kmin) or
        &#x03BB;*=&#x03BB;
ex (else).
Step 2: If kDB &#x2265; kmin, train &#x03BB; RBF networks on paired input&#8211;output patterns
        selected from the DB, in the vicinity of each offspring. Pre&#8211;evaluate the &#x03BB;
      population members on the so&#8211;trained metamodels.  Select the &#x03BB;ex top of
        them, based on dominality and proximity criteria.

Step 3: Evaluate the &#x03BB;ex offspring on the problem&#8211;specific evaluation software.
      Update Sg
e.
Step 4: Compute the current set of principal components based on the updated
      elite set Sg
e  (eqs. 4.5 and 4.6).
Step 5: Align the design space to so&#8211;computed principal components (eq. 4.15).
Step 6: Create the new offspring population Sg+1
&#x03BB;     through the application of
      the evolution operator on the aligned individuals.  Re&#8211;align the generated
      offspring to the original design space coordinate system,(eq. 4.16).
Step 7: Set g&#x2190;g+1; go to step 1.
The above algorithm can readily be transformed to EA(PCA) by eliminating the
use of metamodels or by setting kmin to a practically infinite number.
4.4.3   Investigation of the effects of the use of PCA-driven
         evolution operator in ill-posed optimization prob-

In order to demonstrate the possible performance gain from the use of the PCA-
driven EA ten runs for the aforementioned (Welded beam) case and the two
mathematical test cases presented in section 4.1.3 were performed with different

respect to evaluations, over the ten runs, is presented in fig. 4.13.
   In figure 4.13 one can observe that, even though, the dimension of the prob-
lem was deliberately set very low (N = 2), for observability reasons, something
that as shown in section 4.1.3 decreases the expected gain from the use of the
proposed method.  Nevertheless, though, the proposed method still outperforms
the traditional EA.
   The comparison between traditional evolution operators and PCA-driven one

4.5    EAs assisted by PCA-assisted metamodels
The inexact pre-evaluation (IPE), in which appropriately trained artificial neural
networks are used as metamodels, suffers a lot from the curse of dimensionality.
By increasing the problem dimension, the prediction accuracy of ANNs decreases
and the their training time increases. In this thesis, a method which is capable of,
appropriately, reducing the number of the ANNs sensory nodes is proposed.  As
mentioned above the eigenvectors extracted via PCA performed on the members
of the elite population denote the directions that, if used as design variables,
would lead to a separable objective function.  The eigenvalues computed by the
same PCA denote the variance of the elite set on the corresponding direction. If
a direction has high variance it means that the members of the elite population
are considerably scattered and that this direction is of low importance for the
optimization problem in hand. On the other hand, if a direction has small variance
this means that the members of the elite population are concentrated in a small
region thus the direction is of greater importance for the optimization.   The
proposed method takes advantage of this fact and cuts of the ANNs sensory
nodes that are dedicated to the less important directions of the design space and
thus train a ANN of lower dimension. It is important to node that this truncation
takes place only during the ANN training phase and not during the evolution,
the EA is free to vary any of the complete set of the design variables and its not
limited to a subset of them.
   To this end, first, all the selected training patterns have to be rotated/aligned
with the eigenvectors and then, the less important (higher eigenvalues) compo-
nents of them are cut of.
   For the purpose of demonstration,  the proposed method is applied to the
welded beam problem since this problem has two degrees of freedom. The use of
the IPE technique, in its standard form, would require the use of RBF networks
with two sensory nodes each.   They must be trained on neighbouring to the
candidate solution, already evaluated stored individuals as shown in figure 4.16.
   The proposed method suggests RBF networks with only a single sensory node
to be trained on the most significant direction with respect to &#x03A6;, paired with the
output (fig.4.17-right). This is the direction with the smallest eigenvalue resulting

        from the use of PCA on the current elite-set. In figures 4.9 and 4.16 the principal
        directions (eigenvectors) are shown, &#x03BB;1  denoted the principal direction with the
        largest eigenvalue and &#x03BB;2  the one with the smallest eigenvalue.
           From figure 4.17, one may see that the &#8220;shape&#8221; of the &#x03A6; distribution over
        the design space (in the vicinity the candidate solution) can be captured by
        considering only the &#x03BB;2 direction on the other hand the &#x03BB;1 direction in much less
        important. In fact, in this MOO case direction &#x03BB;1 points tangential to the current
        Pareto front approximation and goes through designs of about same &#x03A6; value. The
        aforementioned technique is expected to enhance the MAEA efficiency in high-
        dimensional problems by reducing the minimum amount of DB entries being
        necessary before the IPE phase starts, reducing the metamodel training time and
        leading to more dependable objective function predictions by the metamodel.

  posed method suggest RBF networks (used as metamodel by the IPE technique)
  to be trained only on the (&#x03A6;,&#x03BB;2) plane.  Training RBF networks on the (&#x03A6;,&#x03BB;1)
  plane, as it is shown in the left figure here, would be of no use since a) the pre-
  diction quality of the network would be bad due to the scattering of the training
  patterns and b) the &#x03BB;1  direction is of lower importance with respect to &#x03A6; thus it
  holds less information on the quality of the to-be-evaluated design.
4.5.1   Investigation of the effects of the use of PCA as-
         sisted metamodels in ill-posed optimization prob-
         lems
To demonstrate the possible performance gain from the use of the proposed PCA
assisted metamodels 10 runs for the two mathematical test cases presented in
section 4.1.3 were performed with different random number generator seeding.
The results of them are presented below.
   Regarding comparison between traditional metamodels using PCA only to
drive the evolution operators (MAEA(PCA)) and PCA assisted metamodels or
M(PCA)AEA(PCA) of the 30D non-separable ellpsoid with a = 1000 (eq.  4.3)
is presented in fig.  4.18.  The plots refer to the mean objective function values
of the aforementioned 10 runs.  IPE phase for MAEA(PCA) initiated after 300
individuals where stored in the database and 25 to 29 training patterns, in the
&#x211C;30  space,  where used to train the RBF networked employed as metamodel.
Regarding the M(PCA)AEA(PCA), IPE phase started after only 100 individuals
where stored in the database since only 4 to 8 training patterns, in the truncated
&#x211C;10  space, where required for the RBF network training.  The &#x211C;10  is comprised

           Regarding the multidimensional and multi-modal test case of eq.4.4, compar-
        ison between MAEA(PCA) and M(PCA)AEA(PCA) are presented for the 30D
        version in fig.4.19.  Regarding MAEA(PCA) IPE phase initiated after 300 indi-
        viduals where stored in the date base and 15 to 19 training patterns, in the &#x211C;30
        space, where used to train the metamodel. As far at the M(PCA)AEA(PCA) is
        concerned, the training pattern dimension was truncated from 30 to the 10 most
        important regarding f.  That allowed for the IPE phase to start after only 100
        individuals where stored in the database since only 5 to 9 training patterns where
        required for the RBF network training.
           In figures 4.18 and 4.19 one can observe that the use of PCA assisted meta-
        models further enhances the MAEA efficiency.

  Figure 4.19: Convergence comparison between for the 30D multi-modal case (eq.
  4.4).The proposed M(PCA)AEA(PCA) method outperform the MAEA(PCA) one.
   The blade airfoil is designed subject to a number of aerodynamic and geomet-
rical constraints:  the optimal airfoil must turn the flow by more than 30o  and
ensure that its thickness at three chord-wise positions (0.3c, 0.6c &amp; 0.9c) must be
greater that (0.10c, 0.08c &amp; 0.01c) respectively.
   The airfoil shape is parameterized based on a mean-camber line and thickness
distributions scheme as presented in section 3.3, a parameterization that yields
27 design variables.
   The merits of the proposed M(PCA)AEA(PCA) method will be examined
through the comparison of a traditional MAEA against a M(PCA)AEA(PCA)
where PCA is used both to drive the evolution operators and also during the IPE
phase to reduce the metamodel dimension. The populations for both MAEAs are
&#x03BC; = 20, &#x03BB; = 60 and &#x03BB;e  = 6.  Both cases use local RBF networks as metamod-
els trained on a small number of automatically selected training patterns.  The
MAEA uses a number of 20 to 30 training patterns in the &#x211C;27  space. IPE phase
for MAEA starts after 400 individuals are stores in the database.  Regarding
M(PCA)AEA(PCA) the RBF networks used as metamodels are trained with 5
to 8 training patterns in the reduced as presented above &#x211C;10  space. The reduced
dimension makes possible the use of metamodels significantly earlier, the IPE
phase for M(PCA)AEA(PCA) starts after only 200 individuals are stored in the

Optimization of Hydraulic
Turbomachines
In this chapter, the KBD method presented in Chapter 3 and the MAEAs which
are further assisted by principal component analysis (PCA) presented in Chapter
4, will be used and compared with the conventional optimization tools in large
scale industrial cases related to the design of hydraulic turbines.
     In order to perform a successful optimization, a reliable evaluation procedure
must be available (fig. 5.1). The evaluation procedure used in this chapter com-
prises three parts: the parameterization tool which is able to generate 3D turbine
blade shapes a grid generation tool able to automatically generate grids in any
give geometry able to be described by the paremeterization tool within the design
variable limits and a CFD software. Section 5.1 aims at presenting the basic fea-
tures of the aforementioned tools. Fist among them is the parameterization tool
(section 5.1.1) used to parameterize the complex 3D geometries of any type of
reaction turbine. The space discretization required to numerically solve the Euler
equations is presented in 5.1.2. And, finally, the Euler solver used to predict the
water flow thorough the flow passage is presented in section 5.1.3.
     Post-processing is an indispensable part of the evaluation procedure; the met-
rics, used to quantify the fitness of each candidate solution quality are presented
in section 5.2.
     The first case is dealing with the design of a Francis turbine to be used in
a pre-existing hydroelectric plant.  This case is mainly used to study the gain
from the use of the developed KBD method (chapter 3), as compared with the
                                                           91

traditional EA, in an industrial environment where the availability of archived
past designs, i.e. the outcomes of more or less similar project, is a fact.
   The second case is related to the design of a new type of hydraulic turbines,
the so-called Hydromatrix&#x24C7; turbine.  This case will be mainly used to demon-
strate the gain from the implementation of the PCA-driven evolution operators
(MAEA(PCA)) as compared with a traditional MAEA.
5.1    Evaluation procedure
5.1.1   Parameterization for turbine blades
The parameterization of a hydraulic turbine blade, either of axial, radial or mixed
flow type, consists of two steps.  First step is the parameterization of the 3D
mean camber surface.  The second step is concerned with the thickness of the
blade which is defined by the airfoil shape and the thickness distribution across
the blade (121, 182).
   Starting point of the parameterization of the mean camber surface is its merid-
ional projection.  The meridional projection of the mean camber surface is con-
fined by 4 curves, namely the hub and shroud generatrices and the leading and
trailing edge curves (fig.5.2). All four curves are parameterized by a user defined
number of Bezire points.
   Having defined the meridional projection of the mean camber surface, next
step is the generation of the 3D shape of the mean camber surface. A set of 2D
iso-span lines, distributed between shroud and hub on the meridional surface, are
constructed (fig.5.2).  The 3D shape of the aforementioned lines is constructed
based on their meridional projection and a number of parameters, namely &#x03C1;,&#x03B8;,&#x03B2;,&#x03B6;
and &#x03BC; which are all defined below. These 3D lines are then used as the skeleton
of the blade mean camber surface (fig.5.3).
   The &#x03C1; value is defined at each point, on both the leading and trailing edge,
as the normalized meridional projection arc length of the edge with zero value at
the shroud and unity at the hub (fig.5.2).
   The angular position of the leading and trailing edge is controlled by the

        on the z-centred circle through this point. Therefore &#x03B2;(&#x03C1;) distributions define the
        mean camber surface metal angles throughout the previously defined LE and TE.
        &#x03B2;(&#x03C1;) and &#x03B8;(&#x03C1;) distributions are herein parameterized as bezier curves of a user
        defined degree (fig.5.4).

           The final step in the parameterization of the mean camber surface is to define
        its shape between leading and trailing edge for all the iso-span lines.  This is
        achieved through the conformal mapping &#x03A6;.
                         &#x03A6; : (r,z) &#x2192; &#x03BC;,    &#x03BC; = &#x222B; 1 
rdl                     (5.1)
where l denotes the arc length of the meridional projection of the iso-span line.
This conformal mapping performs the transformation of the iso-span lines from
cylindrical coordinates (r,z,&#x03B8;) to a (&#x03BC;,&#x03B8;) coordinate system. Herein the iso-span
lines (in the (&#x03BC;,&#x03B8;) coordinate system) are defined by Bezier curves of third degree.
The first and last control points are fixed on the, defined by now, LE and TE
points of the iso-span line in hand and the two internal control points depend on
&#x03B6;LE, &#x03B6;TE, &#x03B2;LE and &#x03B2;TE angles respectively (fig.5.5).
   Finally &#x03B6;(&#x03C1;) distribution, one for the LE (&#x03B6;LE) and one for the TE (&#x03B6;TE) define
the position of the two internal control points for all the iso-span lines (0 &#x2264; &#x03C1; &#x2264; 1).
Therefore the &#x03B6; distributions can be seen as the curvature control system of
the aforementioned parameterization of the mean camber surface scheme, since
it defines how strongly the &#x03B2; values at leading and trailing edge will influence
the &#x03B2; values in the interior of the mean camber surface.  Similar to &#x03B8;(&#x03C1;) and

&#x03B2;(&#x03C1;) also &#x03B6;(&#x03C1;) distributions are parameterized as Bezier curves of a user defined
degree(fig.5.5). The inverse conformal mapping &#x03A6;-1 is then used to transform the
iso-span lines from the (&#x03BC;,&#x03B8;) coordinate system back to the cylindrical coordinate
system.

thickness is equal to the one specified by the t(&#x03C1;) distribution. The scaled airfoil
profiles are then superimposed onto the mean camber surface to create the final
3-dimensional geometry (fig.5.7).

5.1.2   Space discretization - Grid generation
A tailor-made for hydraulic turbomachines, able to handle axial, radial and mixed
flow machine, multi-bloc structured grid generator is used in this thesis.  Struc-
tured grids, based on the notion of blocks with fixed topology, can, via stretching
and twisting them, create grids that fit a given body.  A multi-block topology
(several interconnected structure grid blocks) allows the user greater freedom in
constructing grids around complex geometries (fig.5.8).
   In this thesis, with respect to the topological characteristics of hydraulic turbo-
machines, such as the the TE thickness and the extensions towards the inlet and
outlet of the domain, a four block topology is used fig.  5.8.  Block 0 is used to
mesh the area in the vicinity of the blade, capturing the TE thickness, and is of
C-type. Block 1 fills the space between two consecutive blades. Block 2 fills the
space from the inlet to the blade LE and Block 3 fills the space after blocks 0 and
1 up to the outlet.
   Here the user may control the grid via changing the shape of the block edges,
defining number of nodes at each location (fig.5.9) and the distribution of grid-
nodes at the domain-borders (fig.5.10).
   To construct the three-dimensional grid a user-defined number of pseudo two-
dimensional (laying on iso-span surfaces fig 5.11) grids are computed using the
                                                           97

  Figure 5.8:  The four-block topology of a hydraulic turbine.  In the sake of sim-
  plicity, this is shown on the blade-to-blade grid at mid-span. Block 0 is of C-type
  and is used to discretize the area in the vicinity of the blade (herein airfoil). Blocks
  1 to 3 are of rectangular type and are used to fill the space from pressure side to
  suction side, between blade LE and inlet and blade TE and outlet respectively.
grid parameterization as described above and are then combined to create the
final 3D grid.
   It is important to mention that the described grid generation technique can
accommodate a great variation of geometries without failing.  This is of great
importance for a grid technique to be used in an optimization framework. Good
geometries should under no circumstances be classified as &#8221;failed&#8221; due to the
failure of the grid generation process.
   In this thesis both, guide vane and runner blade channels are meshed using a
grid generation tool, with the previous features, developed by Andritz-ASROE.

5.1.3   Flow Solver
Water flow through the hydraulic turbine blades is simulated by a CFD code
developed by Andritz-ASROE. The aforementioned code is a multiblock solver for
incompressible 3D euler flow. The Euler (eq. 5.2) equations are expanded by an
artificial compressibility, the solution is achieved, using the 1D Roe approximate
Riemann solver (163), iteratively by ADI (alternating direction implicit) method
on structured grids.  Convergence is accelerated by a V-cycle multigrid schema.
The solver is developed for hydraulic turbomachines, rotational axis is z-axis.
   In differential form the Euler equations (artificial compressibility approach)
are; 
                                  &#x2202;Q___

   The boundary conditions regarding inlet and outlet, for the herein used solver,
are applied in an explicit way on grouped faces via the phantom cell technique.
This are;
Inlet:     &#8211; total pressure profile and velocity angle;
         &#8211; or velocity profile;
Outlet:     &#8211; static pressure;
         &#8211; or static pressure and radial equilibrium;
         &#8211; or total pressure and radial equilibrium;
   Any combination using the &#8220;velocity profile&#8221; inlet boundary results in a given
massflow and the Hydraulic head is a result form the solution of the flow equa-
tions.  On the the other hand, if the &#8220;total pressure profile and velocity angle&#8221;
inlet boundary condition is used in combination with the &#8220;total pressure and ra-
dial equilibrium&#8221; outlet boundary condition then the Hydraulic head is given and

        the massflow is resulting from the solution of the flow equations.  The choice of
        either configuration plays a significant role in the operating point control as will
        be shown later on.
5.2    Hydraulic turbine-runner quality metrics
The metrics used so as to quantify the quality of the candidate solutions are
presented below.  A metric may coincide with a objective function or part of an
objective function or a constraint used in the optimization problem.
   In this thesis metrics are associated with:
   &#x2219; &#x03C3;: The cavitation behaviour of the blade in hand; cavitation is a common
      problem of all hydraulic machine subject to low pressure liquids, causing
      performance degradation and structural damages.
   &#x2219; M1 The Circumferential and meridional velocity profiles at the exit position
      of the runner; the exit of the runner coincides with the inlet to the draft-tube
      and these profiles significantly affect the matching of the two components.
   &#x2219; M2 The blade loading quality, since equidistributed loading is desired along
      the chordwise direction of the blade at any span-wise location.
   &#x2219; M3 The pumping surface of the blade; in case of non-regulated turbines
      neither the stator nor the rotor blade can be rotated/adjusted to oper-
      ate optimally at every operating point.  In such a case, during part load
      operation, a small part of the blades surface is operating as a pump, i.e.
      pressure side has lower pressure than suction side, this surface is desired to
      be minimized.
5.2.1   Cavitation metric
Cavitation in hydraulic turbines, is the phenomenon of water vaporization (forma-
tion of cavities/bubbles) as the pressure tends to become lower than the vapour
pressure.  When the cavitation bubbles collapse in the vicinity of a solid sur-
face, they can cause erosion, compromising thus both the structural integrity
                                                          103                                                  

                    DRAFT                                              5. Optimization of Hydraulic Turbomachines_______________________________________________________________________________
(removed material) and the hydraulic performance (altered shape) of the ma-
chine (21, 118, 176).  In addition, the collapse of cavitation bubbles generates
noise, via the large, momentary, pressures that are generated when the internal
of the bubble is highly compressed.
   The conventional way to characterize how close the minimum liquid pressure
is to the vapour pressure and, therefore, quantify the danger of cavitation to
occur, is by means of the so-called cavitation number &#x03C3;, defined as,
                              &#x03C3; = p&#x221E;- pv,T&#x221E; 
 0.5&#x03C1;LU2&#x221E;                              (5.4)
where, U&#x221E;,p&#x221E; and T&#x221E; are a reference velocity, pressure and temperature respec-
tively. &#x03C1;L is the liquid density and pv,T&#x221E; is the saturated vapour pressure.
   Clearly if &#x03C3; is sufficiently large, p&#x221E; is large compared with pv,T&#x221E; or U&#x221E;, single-
phase liquid flow will occur. However, if &#x03C3; drops below the &#x03C3; incipient (&#x03C3;i) value
cavitation will occur.  In the simplified case of a liquid that cannot withstand
any tension and in which vapour bubbles appear instantaneously when minimum
pressure (pmin) reaches pv,
                              &#x03C3;i = p&#x221E;- pmin 
 0.5&#x03C1;LU2&#x221E;                              (5.5)
Hence, the incipient cavitation number could be ascertained from observations,
measurements or simulations of the single-phase flow i.e. for &#x03C3; &#x003E; &#x03C3;i the pressure
along the entire flow filed is greater than pv  thus no cavitation occurs.  On the
other hand, if &#x03C3; &#x2264; &#x03C3;i, it exists at least one point in the flow filed with pressure
lower than pv thus cavitation does occur.
   In the case of hydraulic turbines the tendency of the flow to cavitate is char-
acterized by the so called Thoma cavitation coefficient &#x03C3;,
                             &#x03C3; = ptot,exit - pv 
     &#x03C1;LgH                                (5.6)

           The &#x03C3;i for the Thomas cavitation coefficient can be described as
                                       &#x03C3;i = -Cpmin                               (5.9)
        where Cpmin is the Cp value at the location with minimum pressure (pmin).
           The cavitation behaviour of a hydraulic turbine can be observed through the
        Cp  distribution as they are plotted over the hydraulic turbine surfaces.  In fig.
        5.12 the Cp distribution regarding the turbine runner blade at mid-span position
        is depicted.  The three indicative scenarios for this case is; a) &#x03C3; &#x003E; -Cpmin thus
        pv  &#x003C; pmin  and therefore cavitation dose not occur;  b) &#x03C3; = -Cpmin, in which
        case if the assumptions of eq.5.5 and 5.7 are true, the liquid cannot withstand
        any tension and vapour bubbles appear instantaneously when minimum pressure
        (pmin) reaches pv, cavitation will occur at the point of minimum pressure; and c)
        &#x03C3; &#x003C; -Cpmin in which case p &#x003C; pv over a portion of the chord, in the case of the
        chord-wise distribution depicted in fig. 5.12, or area, in the case of the complete
        blade. This region is, therefore, considered cavitated.
           In this thesis, in order to reduce the effects of the assumptions of eq.5.5 and
        eq.5.7, the &#x03C3;-Histogram method (168) is used. In &#x03C3;-Histogram method, during the
        calculation of &#x03C3;i the minimum pressure pmin is replaced with so called histogram
        pressure (pHist) (eq. 5.10). pHist is extracted from the blade pressure distribution
        where a user-defined surface percentage (A) is required to have pressure values
        below pHist fig.5.13.

5.2.2   Outlet velocity profiles
Coupling the turbine runner with a pre-existing draft-tube is controlled via the
outlet velocity profile metrics. This requires the definition of a target distribution
and,  thus,  the corresponding metric stands for the deviation of the acquired
distribution from the target one (fig.5.14).  To perform optimally, a given draft-
tube must have, at its inlet, a specific mass-flow (Cm =   cm __&#x221A;
 __2gH) and specific swirl
(Cu  =    cu ___&#x221A;
 __2gH) span-wise distribution where, cm  and cu  are the meridional and
circumferential components of the flow velocity respectively.
   Therefore the &#8220;outlet velocity quality&#8221; metric is defined as minimization of
the deviation between the acquired distributions and the corresponding target.

   results in increased pHist and therefore reduced &#x03C3;Histi.  A values in this figure are
   exaggerated for sake of presentation.
5.2.3   Blade loading quality metric
Loading quality refers to the way load (eq. 5.11) is destributed along the runner
blade surface. Constant load along the blade, in chordwise direction, is desirable
(fig.5.15) and is linked both to hydraulic quality and good structural behaviour.
                                                          107

  distributions and targets, is depicted hear as the gray area.
Load,  at each blade position,  is defined as the integral of pressure coefficient
deference (CPS
p    - CSS
p  ) over the blade surface.

        optimization should aim at the minimization of standard deviation of the load
        along the blade surface .
5.2.4   Pumping surface metric
In case of non-regulated hydraulic turbines, such as Hydromatrix&#x24C7; (section 5.4),
an extra quality metric, concerning their operation at part load, must be intro-
duced.
   In non-regulated machines neither the stator, nor the rotor blades can be ro-
tated so to adjust incoming/outgoing flow directions. During part load operation,
this leads to flows with negative incidence angles (meet the blade at the suction
side) (fig.5.16) thus creating a region where suction side has higher pressures
than pressure side. This part of the blade is operating as a pump and, in a well
performing turbine, this must be minimum.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  Figure 5.16:  Pressure contour, along with streamlines near the shroud region,
  at part load operation of a non regulated hydraulic turbine.   Water flow near
  the shroud region has negative incidence angle and, therefore the aforementioned
  pumping surface is formed. This surface needs to be minimized.

   In figure 5.16, one may observe the flow streamlines, at the near shroud region,
and how they meet the blade at the suction side (bottom the this plot).  This
causes both a high pressure region at the suction side, due to the stagnation point
at the point where the flow meets the blade, and a low pressure region on the
pressure side (top here) due to high flow speeds.

  rection at part load operation of a non-regulated hydraulic turbine at three spanwise
  locations:  hub, mid-span and shroud.  The pumping area corresponds to the first
  10% of the chord at mid-span and shroud locations
   The partial pumping operation phenomenon can also be observed by the pres-
sure coefficient (Cp) plots, see figure 5.17.  The near hub Cp  distribution (thick
continuous line) exhibits no such phenomenon, as expected. The near shroud Cp
distribution (thick dashed line) though suffers from partial pumping operation.
The near LE region of the shroud Cp distribution exhibits the so called &#8221;crossed&#8221;
distribution which denotes that the pressure at the pressure side of the blade is
lower than that of the suction side.  The thin continues line is the mid-span Cp
distribution and it also suffers from pumping operation, without however being
as severe as close to shroud.

        5.3   Optimization of a Francis Turbine
The design/optimization of a Francis turbine runner will be presented in this sec-
tion. This case, due to the high number of design variables used to parameterize
the candidate geometries, will be used to demonstrate the merits of the KBD
method.
5.3.1   Francis Turbine
Francis turbines are the most common water turbine in use today since they
can operate in a considerable part of the head-discharge diagram (fig.5.18) (48).
Francis is a reaction type water turbine which was named after its developer
James B. Francis.

   A typical Francis turbine consists of four different parts (fig.5.19). The Spiral
casing together with the stay-vanes are designed to provide uniform water intake
around the entire circumference of the wicket-gates inlet.  The wicket-gates (or
guide-wanes) are adjustable blades allowing efficient turbine operation for a range
of water flow conditions. The runner which is the rotating part aims at harnessing
the hydraulic energy. Finally, the draft-tube which is used to control the head of
the water working on the turbine via transforming the outlet kinetic energy into
head.

5.3.2   Case presentation
From the industrial point of view, the design problem in hand is referred to as a
modernization/rehabilitation project; since it mainly aims at upgrading the run-
ner(fig.5.20) for use in a pre-existing power plant.  Modernization/rehabilitation
projects are fairly common world-wide and specially in Europe where almost all
large-hydro locations are already tapped and a lot of them are of a significant
age. Typical reasons for modernization/rehabilitation project are;
 (a) to increase the reliability and availability of the power plant;
 (b) to extent its life and restore its performance;

          (c) to improve its performance, including;
                 &#8211; efficiency and/or power
                 &#8211; reduction of cavitation erosion and
                 &#8211; enlargement of the operating range
         (d) to improve the plant safety;
          (e) to resolve environmental, social or regulatory issues;
          (f) to reduce the maintenance or operating cost;
          (g) to take into account other considerations, such as
                 &#8211; modified governmental regulations,
                 &#8211; political criteria,
                 &#8211; modified hydrology conditions or
                 &#8211; modified market conditions.
           In modernization/rehabilitation projects the designer must ensure that the
        newly designed runner fits perfectly into the pre-existing structure by respecting
        both geometric and hydraulic-behaviour constraints.  Geometric constraints are
        mostly related with the inlet-outlet diameters and the hub-shroud meridional
        contour. On the other hand, hydraulic behaviour enforces given inlet conditions
        and introduces a new objective, apart from efficiency and cavitation, which has
        to do with the drat-tube coupling since the outlet of the newly designed runner is
        also the draft-tube inlet and any given draft-tube works optimally for a specific
        inlet velocity profiles.

The design variables and their corresponding ranges are picked from the set spec-
ified in section 5.1.1 through a graphical interface integrated in the parameteri-

5.3.2.2   Objectives and Constraints
The objectives vector consist of two objectives, namely the outlet velocity profile
metric (M1) and the blade loading quality (M2) one.  Regarding M1  the user
defined target profiles as they are shown in figure 5.22.
   To ensure performance stability, the runner to be designed is desirable to yield
optimal performance at three operating points, the best efficiency (BE), part load
(PL) and full load (FL) ones.  The three-operating-point design is handled as
an optimization problem with two objectives, where the value of each objective
function is computed for each operating point separately (equation 5.12) and,
then, the &#8220;overall&#8221; value Fi is set equal to the weighted sum (equation 5.13) of
the corresponding values for the three operating points. (table. 5.2)

   For each operating point two constraints are set (table 5.3). The first is to en-
force cavitation safety and the second to ensure the operating point. Cavitation
constraint is based on the &#x03C3;Hist method as presented in section 5.2.1. Operating
point control is materialised with a constrain that is defined as a maximum dis-
tance from the desired operating point.  Here, given that the massflow is given

5.3.3   Results
As mentioned above,  this case is used to demonstrate the merits of the first
original idea proposed in this thesis namely the KBD method in a real industrial
case.  Therefore, two optimization procedures are performed; one by using the
conventional EA since the large number of design variables (336) makes the use of
metamodels (MAEA) non effective; and one utilizing the MAEA(KBD) method.
5.3.3.1   Archived designs
Three archived designs where available (fig.5.23).  These designs were developed
to perform optimally in operating points close to those set for the desired blade.
The criteria used to estimate this vicinity were the undimensional specific speed
NED and specific massflow QED as defined in equation 5.15.
                         NED =  n _

     The archived designs to be used as basis vectors for this case are re-evaluated
at the desirable operating points and their quality metrics are summarized in
table 5.4.

  used for this case.
   A closer look at B1 reveals the findings tabulated in table 5.4. Firstly, based
on figure 5.24,  where the Cp  contour is plotted over the runner surfaces,  the
cavitational behaviour can be observed. In this figure one may observe the lower
limit of Cp  =  -0.216 which advocates the presence of cavitation,  since &#x03C3;i  &#x2248;
-Cp = 0.216 .  Remember that &#x03C3; = 0.2 and that &#x03C3;i  must be grater than &#x03C3; for
cavitation to appear.  A closer look at the &#x03C3;Hist
i      value which is equal to 0.21
confirms that observation.  It is reminder that &#x03C3;Hist
i      is a better estimation of &#x03C3;i
than the -Cp  one.  So, archived design B1 is suffering from cavitation even for
the BE operating point. Figure 5.24 shows that cavitation (regions with low Cp)
is observed at the suction side, near the trailing edge, between mid-span and
shroud. Archived design B1 suffers from cavitation at the PL operating point too
and is marginally safe at FL operating point (table 5.4).
   Furthermore, regarding B1, in figure 5.25 one can observe the noticeable devi-

           The loading quality, of B1, can be demonstrated through the Cp chord-wise
        (eq.  5.8) distribution along the hub, mid-span and shroud positions (fig.  5.26).
        Although mid-span and hub demonstrate relatively good loading behaviour, the
        blade part which is close to the shroud suffers from important loading differences.

   Regarding B2, the blade suffers from cavitation at all three operating points,
see table 5.4. Figure 5.27 depicts the Cp contour concerning the archived geometry
B2 operating at the BE operating point.  The lower limit of Cp, (Cp = -0.234)
denotes the possible presence of cavitation which is confirmed by the &#x03C3;Hist
i      values
(table 5.4).  Figure 5.27 shows that cavitation occurs on suction side near the
trailing edge at the near hub region.

   The archived geometry B3 is clean from cavitation in all but the PL operating
point, see table 5.4.  Figure 5.30 shows the Cp  contour for the geometry B3 at
the PL operating point. The lower limit of Cp = -0.215 depicts the presence of
cavitation, this is also confirmed by the &#x03C3;Hist
i      calculation (table 5.4). Cavitation
is observed at the suction side near the trailing edge.

           The fact that neither of the three archived designs neither shows good out-
        let velocity profiles and loading qualities nor respects the imposed constraints
        reveals the necessity of a revise step.  The revise step takes place using an EA

as a design-optimization technique.  The setup of the two separate optimization
procedure that take place here follows.  The first is utilizing a conventional EA
(&#x03BC; = 30,&#x03BB; = 120) using the 336 design variables imposed by the design param-
eterization.  The second optimization procedure is utilizing the proposed KBD
method, MAEA(KBD) (&#x03BC; = 20,&#x03BB; = 60,&#x03BB;e = 4 to 8, with IPE phase starting af-
ter 150 non-failed individuals stored in the DB), with 19 optimization variables.
For both optimizations, the three archived designs are injected in the population
of the first generation.
   Regarding KBD, the aforementioned 19 optimization variables are generated
(eq.  3.6) from the grouping of the design variables of each archived geometries
into 6 groups (table 5.5) and the introduction of the extrapolation variable &#x03A8;.
This arrangement generated 6 weights controlling the influence of each archived
geometry for the candidate solution thus 18 weight in total. The 18 weights plus
the extrapolation variable &#x03A8; are the 19 optimization variables.

        using the hypervolume indicator (184). The hypervolume indicator assumes that
        the quality of a Pareto front can be quantified in a scalar value that is the dom-
        inated, by the Pareto front, portion of the objective space as it is restricted by
        a constant reference point. The larger value the hyper-volume indicator has the
        grated is the quality of the Pareto front in hand is.
           The comparison of the evolution of the hypervolume indicator in terms of the
        number of exact evaluations, as computed for both the optimization procedures
        are depicted in figure 5.33.  The exact evaluation count is used as a measure of
        the computational cost.

   tween EA and the proposed MAEA(KBD) method.
           The MAEA(KBD) method significantly outperforms the conventional EA. It
        starts with a significantly better individuals as members of the first generation
        which demonstrates that, even though the archived geometries are far from the
        optimal design, the grouping of the design variables and the use of normal dis-
        tribution to set the importance regions in the design space are very close to the
        &#8220;physics&#8221; of the problem in hand.
           Looking at the final fronts of non-dominated solutions as they are computed
        by the two methods (fig.  5.34), computed at the same computational cost of

  5.35 to 5.41).
MAEA(KBD) method is evident.  On of the non-dominated solutions computed
by the MAEA(KBD), namely the one marked with A, was chosen for further
examination.
   The quality metrics of design A are summarized in table 5.6.  To compare
design A with the archived ones,  these metrics should be compared with the
values in table 5.4. This comparison reveals that, design A is significantly better
that the three archived designs at all operating points and for both objectives.
Design A is an overall high quality blade.
   The behaviour of the selected design A regarding cavitation clearly be ob-
served in figures 5.36,  5.37 and 5.38 regarding the BE,PL and FL operating
points respectively.
   Regarding the BE operating point the lowest Cp  value, as it is observed in
figure 5.36, is equal to -0.179 suggesting the absence of cavitation.
   For the PL operating point the lowest Cp value is equal to -0.192 and therefore

        5.4   Optimization of a Hydromatrix&#x24C7; Turbine
The design-optimization of a complete Hydromatrix&#x24C7; turbine will be presented
in this section.  This case will be used to demonstrate the merits of employing
the MAEA(PCA) method, proposed in this thesis, since many industrial cases,
such as the design of a Hydromatrix&#x24C7; turbine, do comprise ill-posed optimization
problems which, as shown in chapter 4, cause performance degradation in EAs.
5.4.1   The Hydromatrix&#x24C7; turbine
Hydromatrix&#x24C7; is an axial reaction type water turbine (fig.5.42) developed by
Andritz Hydro as an innovative solution for the development of low head hy-
dropower sites (1, 2).  The concept of Hydromatrix&#x24C7; is the use of a number of
small non-regulated (fixed blade) turbines in the place of a conventional large
regulated one (fig.5.43) . The proposed way to Regulate a Hydromatrix&#x24C7; system
is via closing/opening a number of turbines so to keep the massflow per open
turbine as close as possible to that of its BE operating point. If the flow exceeds
the turbines capacity, in order to avoid flood, a number of turbines can be raised
or removed from its operating position like a gate (fig. 5.43).
                                                                                                                                              
   Figure 5.42: Optimization of a Hydromatrix&#x24C7; Turbine: Matrix turbine and its
   main hydraulic parts (1, 2).
     The Hydromatrix&#x24C7; ability to use existing weir structures reduces the ad-
ditional civil works to minimum and enables power plant operators to install
                                                          135

hydroelectric power plants at extremely competitive costs with minimal environ-
mental im-pact.  The number of matrix turbines and their arrangement in rows
depends on the existing civil structure and its position relative to the head- and
tail-water elevations. The use of a number of small turbine generator units (also
known as &#8220;modules&#8221;) results in simple and robust turbine and generator design.
The standardized modular factory assembled grid or &#8220;matrix&#8221; (fig. 5.43) results
in short project schedules and high availability.  A Hydromatrix&#x24C7; turbine con-
sists of three different parts: the distributor cone containing the stay-wanes, the
runner and the draft-tube (fig.5.42).

                   generator units can be specifically designed to operate in both flow
                   directions.
                 &#8211; Abandoned shiplocks: Due to increasing navigation and transport ac-
                   tivities on major rivers, the original shiplocks have become too small
                   and new shiplocks were built.
5.4.2   Case presentation
This  section  is  concerned  with  the  design  of  a  complete  Hydromatrix&#x24C7; tur-
bine for a given hydroelectric plant.  This design is of great importance since
Hydromatrix&#x24C7; is, in fact, a new type of hydro turbine and within their operat-
ing range lays a high number of untapped locations worldwide.
5.4.2.1   Case formulation
The design problem in hand consists of the design of the rotor blades, rotor hub
and stay-vane end-tips.  The distributor cone, the runner shroud and the draft
tube are fixed due to the modular construction and the generator size (fig.5.44).
5.4.2.2   Design parameterization
In this case the vector of design variables is decomposed into two parts, one which
is associated with the design of the runner blade and the hub and another one
associated with the stay-vanes.  The first part is based on the parameterization
presented in section 5.1.1 and is using 52 design variables to describe the rotor
blade mean surface, its thickness distribution and also define the hub generatrices
                                                          137

  representation, with red are the free to design parts and black are the fixed due to
  construction constraints parts.
(table.  5.7).  The second part of the parameterization is associated solely with
the stay-vanes TE, stay-vanes thickness distributions are frozen due to structural
reasons (stay-vanes have to hold both the generator and runner weight in place)
and stay-vane LE is fixed since the flow meets the stay-vanes with a given, axial,
velocity.  The EA is concerned only with the first part of the parameterization.
The second part is used to regulate the BE operating point as will be shown later.
   The first step for evaluating the performance of each runner geometry is the
numerical simulation of the water flow through the turbine, section 5.1.3.  The
solver uses as input the rotational velocity (n) and the total pressure drop from
inlet to outlet (H). For a specified geometry, the flow rate Q is one of the outcomes
of the aforementioned flow-solver. To get the desired Q value in order to operate
at the BE operating point, a procedure which iteratively deflects the stator blades
TE (second part of the parameterization) is used. This procedure is explained in
detail in section 8.1.1.  So even if the optimization problem deals only with the
design of the runner, the trailing part of the stator blade adapt its self so to fit
the given rotor.  The designer defines the maximum number of iterations of the
deflection angle &#x03B1; which are allowed to perform before reaching the desired Q
value. This iterative process is the main reason that the CPU cost per evaluation
may noticeably vary.
5.4.2.3   Objectives and Constraints
The objectives vector consist of two objectives,  first among them (F1) is the
outlet velocity profile metric (M1) and second (F2) is the combination of (a) blade

        surface metric (M3).  The first objective is, therefore, dedicated to the draft-
        tube coupling quality of the design.  The second objective on the other hand is
        dedicated at the pressure distribution over the runner blade quality, incorporating
        all the quality metrics that have to do with that.  Outlet velocity profile is a

        drive the evolution operators or the so-called MAEA(PCA) method.  Therefore,
        two optimization runs were performed using the conventional MAEA and the
        proposed MAEA(PCA).
           In both optimizations, either with the MAEA or the MAEA(PCA), the pop-
        ulation sizes were: &#x03BC;=30 and &#x03BB;=90. In such a problem, the quite high value of
        &#x03BB; is really necessary since the blade shape parameterization and the associated
        bounds of the design variables allow many infeasible solutions (intolerable shapes)
        to be generated.  As an example, 88 of the 90 individuals of the first generation
        correspond to infeasible geometries and they all must be penalized.  The inex-
        act pre-evaluation started once 300 non-failed individuals entered the DB. Up to
        &#x03BB;e =18 top individuals per generation were allowed to undergo re-evaluation on
        the CFD tool.  Locally valid RBF networks were used as metamodels; each of
        them was trained on a few previously evaluated individuals in its vicinity. Based
        on the algorithm presented in (111),  the user defines the minimum (12) and
        maximum (16) number of training patterns to be used.  It is important to note
        that, due to the very strict constraints, the DB records a great number of pre-
        viously evaluated solutions which are given &#8220;death penalty&#8221;. The presence of so
        many infeasible entries in the DB should be avoided since it prevents dependable
        metamodels to be trained.
           The application of the PCA-assisted evolution operators started at the 5th
        generation.  In fig. 5.46, the performance of MAEA and MAEA(PCA) are com-
        pared, based on the evolution of the hypervolume indicator.
           MAEA(PCA) constantly finds a better front of non-dominated solutions dur-
        ing the entire course of evolution, at the same computational cost. From another
        point of view, the quality of the front non-dominated solutions obtained after
        2000 CFD-based evaluations can be obtained at less than half this CPU cost of
                                                          141

  operators apply at the (5th) generation, i.e.  after about 4&#x00D7;90 = 360 evaluations
  based on the CFD tool, the first parts of the two curves are identical.

   The outlet flow quality of design A is depicted in fig. 5.49. Target distributions
are achieved as desired.
   Furthermore the Cp profiles at the BE, PL and FL operating points are de-
picted in figures 5.51,5.50 and 5.52,  respectively.   The inevitable,  due to the
propeller type of the turbine, pumping surface makes its appearance at the PL
operating point as expected.  It is though kept at the minimum possible level.
The pumping surface spans form mid-span to shroud as can be seen in figure
5.50.  A small amount of pumping surface is allowed at the PL operating given
that this is a non-regulated machine.
   The pumping surface phenomenon and it cause is observable in figure 5.53.

        Pumping surface is the surface depicted with dark blue color on the blades pres-
        sure side.  This is caused by the negative incidence angle, which means that the
        flow meets the blade at the suction side.  This can be observed by comparing
        figures 5.53, 5.55, and 5.54, for the PL, FL and BE operating points respectively
        respectively.   The &#8220;best&#8221; incidence angle is associated with the BE operating
        point. The FL operating point shows a higher than the BE incidence angle, thus
        creating a lower pressure region near the LE at the suction side, compare figures
        5.52 and 5.51. As mentioned above, the PL operating point suffers from negative
        incidence angle, thus creating a region of higher pressure region near the LE at
        the suction side, compare figures 5.50 and 5.51, the so-called pumping surface
        phenomenon.

Optimization of a compressor
cascade
In this chapter, the design-optimization of a stationary annular compressor cas-
cade will be presented.  This case will be used to demonstrate the merits of the
proposed M(PCA)AEA(PCA) method, as described in chapter 4, compared with
the standard MAEA.
     The, as described in (42), compressor cascade this chapter is dealing with has
been installed at LTT/NTUA. The existing cascade was designed by SNECMA
for investigating tip-clearance effects at high Mach numbers 1.
     The evaluation software used in the optimization procedure was solving the
Navier-Stokes equations through a time-marching, vertex centred, finite volume
method suitable for unstructured hybrid grids.   The aforementioned software
was developed and validated in LTT/NTUA (13, 104).   Transport terms are
discretized via a the, second order upwind, Roe scheme (163).   On the other
hand, diffusion terms via a linear interpolation scheme.  Second order spacial
accuracy is achieve via the MUSCL scheme (181) and convergence monotonicity
via the &#8220;van Leer&#8211;van Albada&#8221; bounding function (180).
    1Experimental  measurements  on  this  cascade  were  performed  in  the  framework  of  the

6.1    Case presentation
Two different optimization procedures, with the same 20 design variables, are
presented here in order to demonstrate the gains for the use of a combination of
the methods proposed in chapter 4. The first optimization run carried out made
use of the standard MAEA with &#x03BC;=20, &#x03BB;=60 and &#x03BB;e =4. The IPE phase started
once the first 220 individuals have been stored in the DB. As metamodels, RBF
networks were used trained on a number of training patterns that varies between
20 and 30; all training patterns are defined in the 20-dimensional space.  The
second optimization run relied on the proposed M(PCA)AEA(PCA) method and
was using the same population sizes as the MAEA one.  As metamodels RBF
networks was used here as well but this time trained on 5 - 8 training patterns;
all the training patterns are defined in the reduced, as proposed, 10 dimensional
space. In this case, due to the reduced dimension, the IPE phase can start earlier
after 150 individuals stored in the database.

6.1.1   Blade Shape parameterization
Since the blade shape is identical along the spanwise direction, the parameteriza-
tion of a single airfoil is enough to parameterize the entire blade shape. NURBS
curves are used to control both sides of the airfoil.  To parameterize either the
suction or the pressure side, 15 control points where used. Among them, 5 were
free, and given that each control point has two degrees of freedom (its two coor-
dinates) the number of design variables is 5 &#x00D7; 2 for the each side, yielding, thus,
20 degrees of freedom in total.

  control point may lay in.
6.1.2   Objectives &amp; Constraints
The problem in hand is a single objective problem aiming at the minimization of
the spanwise average Pressure Loss Coefficien PLCav.  The PLCav  value is the
                                      154

        average of the PLC(r) values (computed at each radial position), where 
                                    PLC(r) = pt,inl - pt(r) 
 pt,inl - pinl                        (6.1)
           Furthermore, the problem in hand must respect aerodynamic and geometrical
        constraints. The aerodynamic ones require that the minimum average outlet flow
        angle should not exceed 53o, namely &#x03B1;
2 &#x003C; 53o. The blade of the compressor cas-
        cade which is installed at LTT/NTUA has &#x03B1;2 = 52.12o. Geometrical constraints
        are used to impose the desirable minimum thickness of the airfoil at three posi-
        tions, namely at 30%,  60% and 90% of the chord. Minimum acceptable thickness
        was set as the 90% of the initial design thickness.
6.2    Results
Figure 6.5 demonstrates the evolution of the objective function PLCav values with
respect to of the number of evaluations for the two, MAEA and M(PCA)AEA(PCA),
methods. The use of PCA during the metamodel training in the IPE phase allows
for use of metamodels as surrogate evaluation tools in an earlier stage of the evo-
lution (fig. 6.4), since the RBF training takes place in a reduced dimension and
therefore less training patterns are required. Furthermore, the use of PCA during
the application of the evolution operators allows the exploitation of correlations
between the design variables to further increase EA&#8217;s efficiency (fig. 6.5).
   The optimal airfoil shape resulting from the use of M(PCA)AEA(PCA), yield-
ing PLCav  = 0.104 is presented in figure 6.6.  This design respects all geomet-
rical and aerodynamic constraints.  Outlet flow angle for the resulting airfoil is
&#x03B1;2 = 52.6o
   Finally the pressure contour of the optimal blade is presented in figure 6.7.

Epilogue - Outcome
Goal of this PhD thesis was to propose, develop and validate new methods aim-
ing at upgrading Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) into design-optimization tool
with reasonable computing cost capable to undertake large-scale industrial op-
timization problems in the fields of thermal and hydraulic turbomachines.  The
proposed methods are validated, throughout this PhD thesis, in cases ranging
from some low-cost mathematical optimization benchmarks to 2D compressor
cascade designs and, finally, to the design of industrial 3D hydraulic turbines and
a 3D compressor cascade with tip clearance installed at LTT/NTUA.
     The contribution of the PhD thesis can be summarized in the three innovative
methods presented below.
  (a) The  Knowledge  Based  Design  (KBD)  method.   Which  is  a  new  design
        method able to fully exploits a small number of archived designs with good
        performance in &#8221;similar&#8221; conditions.
 (b) The use of principal component analysis (PCA) as a means to reveal the
        topological characteristics of the elite set and exploit them to transform
        any ill-posed optimization problem into a well-posed one via new, dynamic,
        evolution operators.
  (c) The bilateral use of the same PCA to assist the used of ANNs as metamodels
        in high-dimensional optimization problems.

   Using the, proposed by this PhD thesis, methods the use of EAs in large-scale
industrial applications (high number of design variables and ill-posed optimiza-
tion problems) in acceptable by industry turn-around times became possible.
In example,  the overall design time (not only the optimization procedure) of
a Hydromatrix&#x24C7; hydraulic turbine was reduced for a percentage grater than
50%, from appropriately 120 to 140 days to only 50.  Which, in turn, reduced
significantly the over cost of the design procedure and therefore deemed econom-
ically feasible the use of Hydromatrix&#x24C7; for sites with even lower hydraulic hight,
H = 2-5m, and volume flow rates lower than previously possible 60m3&#x2215;s. This,
in combination with the fact that the availability of sites with the aforementioned
characteristics in Europe is approximately 6000GWh&#x2215;year 1 suggest an estima-
tion of the expected earnings (environmental and economical) from the used of
the developed methods only in the design of Hydromatrix&#x24C7;.
   The, developed during this PhD thesis, software is currently in use by one of
the largest companies in the field of hydroelectric power plants, Andritz-Hydro.
The aforementioned company uses the developed software in a regular basis for the
design of a wide range of rotating parts of hydraulic machines including runners
for Francis, Kaplan, Bulb, Pump and Pump-Turbines.  The developed software
is also used by Andritz-Hydro in the design of static parts such as drafttubes
and distributors. A number of hydraulic machines, whom their design was aided
by the presented in this PhD methods are currently installed, or to be installed,
worldwide.

8.1   Accommodating Single- and Double-regulated
       hydraulic turbines.
In order to increase the hydraulic turbine flexibility,  in terms of variation in
flowrate (Q) and hydraulic head (H), the concept of regulation is used.  A regu-
lated hydraulic turbine is a turbine with adjustable blades, either stator or rotor
or both. An adjustable blade is a blade that can be rotated around a predefined
axis through a specially design mechanism.
8.1.1   Single-regulated turbines
Hydraulic turbines that have only one set of adjustable blades (usually they are
the stator blades) are called single-regulated turbines (see figure 8.1).  Typical
examples of this type are; Francis turbines, axial fixed blade propeller turbine has
adjustable stator blades and the so called semi-Kaplan concept were fixed stator
blades and adjustable rotor blades are used.  Although the angle of rotation of
the adjustable blades (&#x03B1;) for each operating point can be treated as additional
design variables equal in number to the number of operating points, a different
approach is proposed in this thesis.
     The proposed approach to the single-regulated turbine problem aims in elim-
inating both the introduction of the additional constraints and,  more impor-
tantly, the necessity of imposing the so-called operating point constraints.  This
                                                          163

is achieved by assuring that each candidate solution will operate at the appropri-
ate &#x03B1; so as to operate at the desirable operating point. Should this be the case,
then the quality metrics are computed and the evolution continuous as presented
before.
   The aforementioned approach, takes place by enxancing the candidate solution
evaluation procedure so at to calculate the appropriate &#x03B1; given the desirable
operating point. This is achieved through the algorithm presented below.

8.1.2   Double-regulated turbines
Hydraulic turbines that have two sets of adjustable blades (rotor and stator) are
called double-regulated turbines (see figure 8.2). Typical examples of this is the

Kaplan turbine.  Herein the angle of rotation of the adjustable stator blades is
denoted as &#x03B1; (in accordance with the previous section) and of the rotor blades
as &#x03B2;.  Furthermore, apart from the operation in the desirable operating point,
the Cu  velocity component at the outlet of the runner at the hub position is
required to have the user-defined (through the target Cu distribution) value, the
second requirement is denoted as S. Regarding the operating point requirement,
the Q variation will be used as before, having in mind that it could easily be
transformed to the H one.

        8.2   Experimental Validation of the design of a
       Hydromatrix&#x24C7;
The experimental validation of a design that took place using the methods pre-
sented in this thesis is presented in this section.  This design took place in the
scope of the EU funded project named &#8220;HYDROACTION &#8211; Development and
laboratory testing of improved action and Matrix hydro turbines designed by
advanced analysis and optimization tool&#8221; (FP7: Project Number 211983).
     The design variable is based on the parameterization (as presented in chapter
5) and is using 52 design variables to describe the rotor blades mean surface,
thickness distribution and hub generatrices (table. 5.7).
     To ensure performance stability, the runner was desired to perform optimally
at three operating points (BE, PL and FL), table 8.1.

     The objectives vector consist of three objectives, first among them (F1) is the
outlet velocity profile metric (M1), second (F2) is the combination of (a) blade
loading quality metric (M2), (b) the cavitation index &#x03C3;histogram, and third (F3) is
the pumping surface metric (M3).
     Due to the multi operating point design problem, three objective (fi

   The resulting front of non-dominated solutions computed at the cost of 2000
evaluations is presented in figure 8.3. The upgrade of &#x03C3; from a constrained to an
objective gave the ability, with a single optimization run, to acquire a number
of designs each of them optimum for different levels of &#x03C3;.  It is reminded that a
design can operate with higher &#x03C3; without suffering from cavitation if its placed
deeper, thus having a greater mass of water above it.  Also the Hydromatrix&#x24C7;
turbines are usually placed on a number of rows one above the other, therefore
the aforementioned upgrade of &#x03C3; to an objective gives the ability with only a
single run to acquire all turbines needed for an entire project.
   Regarding the experimental validation of the acquired by the proposed in
this thesis methods, a single design from the computed front of non-dominated
solutions was selected, build and measured in test rig L2b of Andritz Hydro GmbH
in Linz, Austria (see figure 8.6).  The selected design will later be compared,

        In L2b, three pumps are used to create the desirable hydraulic energy (Q,H). The
        model turbine is installed between head and tail water tank.
           The model head is regulated by the pump speed and the tail water elevation
        is simulated by the pressure in the downstream tank.  The downstream tank is
        connected to a vacuum vessel and to compressed air as well. This allows varying
        the pressure in the downstream tank for the simulation of the necessary cavitation

data acquisition system is used. The model head (H) is measured from the static
pressure difference between headwater tank and tail water tank and the velocity
difference in the measurement sections (distributor cone inlet and draft tube
outlet).  The massflow (Q) is measured with an inductive discharge flow meter
and the rotational speed is measured via a incremental encoder with a resolution
of 1024 Impules per revolution. All measuring instruments were calibrated either
by primary normals or by using calibration devices which are calibrated with a
primary normal.  Furthermore the runner blades geometry were checked with a
3D coordinate measurement machine by an external company.

   The efficiency (&#x03B7;) measurements were performed with at the minimum model
Reynolds number of 4 &#x00D7; 106  and minimum specific hydraulic energy of 30J&#x2215;kg

        also measured in the same configuration, in a relative efficiency chart in figure
        8.7.
           The experimental validation of a Hydromatrix&#x24C7; design showed that the pro-
        posed by this thesis methods can deliver high quality designs,  acceptable by
        industrial standards. Furthermore the overall design time was reduced from ap-
        proximately 120 - 140 days to only 50.  This reduction in time, and therefore
        resources, combined with the ability to treat turbine parts, such the draft tube,
        as standardised components (merely requiring their coupling properties) resulted
        in the reduction of each Hydromatrix&#x24C7; unit by, approximately one third.
           This cost reduction makes economically feasible the application of Hydromatrix&#x24C7;
        turbines in power plants with even lower H (below 5m, as low as 2m) and rel-
        atively small (smaller than 60m3&#x2215;s) discharges.  The economic impact of this
        improvement can be very important as the current estimations for the potential
        of sites between 2 and 5 meters is approximately 6, 000 GWh per year in Europe
        alone1, a market worth potentially more than a billion Euro per year. The envi-
        ronmental impact, assuming that Hydromatrix&#x24C7; turbines will manage to exploit
        5% of that market by the year 2020 and therefore 300 GWh/year, is calculated
        using the relevant conversion factors 2 to enough to power for more than 84, 000
        European households and will save the emission 189, 000 tons of CO2  per year.
