This PhD thesis aims at proposing, developing and validating new Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) variants for solving design-optimization problems at reasonable computing cost. This is extremely useful when handling large-scale industrial optimization problems, such as in the fields of thermal and hydraulic turbomachines. The developed EA variants, enhanced with the proposed add-on features, must be able to produce high quality designs, at acceptable (according to the industrial standards) turn-around time. The later is, in fact, necessary for EAs to become a design-optimization tool routinely used in an industrial environment. To reduce the optimization turn-around time, a method which overcomes the standard shape parameterization techniques which, in real-world applications, introduce a great number of design variables, is firstly proposed. To this end, this thesis proposes and evaluates a way to use the information residing into a small number of archived designs, made available from similar successful projects worked out in the past. This leads to optimization problems with much less unknowns which can be solved using EAs at noticeably lower computing cost. The proposed method combines ``ideas'' from the theory of Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) with the  EAs, giving rise to a fast design method, to be referred to as Knowledge-Based Design (KBD). Furthermore, the degradation in EAs efficiency/speed when used to solve ill-posed problems motivated the development of a method able to recover a great part of the efficiency loss. In this thesis, Ill-posed optimization problems are defined as the ones dealing with non-separable (section \ref{Nonsep}), and therefore anisotropic (section \ref{IllCon}), objective functions. A non-separable objective function, as opposed to a separable one, cannot be solved as N (N being the number of unknowns) separate optimization problems since the optimal value of each unknown depends on the choice of the rest. This leads to superlinear increase, with respect of N, in computational cost something that, in comparison with the linear increase for separable problems, gets more significant as N increases. Keep in mind that the majority of industrial-scale problems are, in fact, non-separable and require a great number of unknowns.  The proposed method makes use of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify directions in the design space which, if used to reformulate the design problem by introducing new design variables, would result in  non-ill-posed optimization problems.  This information is, then, used to modify the evolution operators, leading to more efficient search.  A by-product of the aforementioned method is the assignment of ``importance'' to each design variable (or design space coordinate). Metamodel-Assisted EAs (MAEAs), in which the costly problem-specific evaluation tool (herein a CFD code) is replaced by surrogate evaluation models or metamodels (trained artificial neural networks, ANNs, polynomial regression methods, etc.), may benefit from the importance-based ranking of the design space coordinates, in order to overcome problems caused by the so-called curse of dimensionality. A method based on the truncation of the ANN entries is proposed, which leads to dependable metamodels for use during the inexact pre-evaluation phase of the MAEA performs much better.  

The aforementioned methods are validated in cases ranging from  some low-cost mathematical optimization benchmarks to 2D compressor cascade designs. Problems such as to the design of industrial 3D hydraulic turbines and the redesign of a 3D peripheral compressor cascade with tip clearance installed at LTT/NTUA have also been examined. The mathematical benchmarks have low computing cost and allow, thus, the exhaustive investigation of methods by repeating the runs, using different seeds for the random number generator, on the same case. The presented 2D cases allow the demonstration of the methods in simple aerodynamic optimization cases. Furthermore, two types of hydraulic turbines, a Francis and a new type named Hydromatrix$\circledR$, are used to validate the performance of the aforementioned methods in large-scale industrial applications. A number of performance metrics are introduced and, depending on the case, these are combined to form the necessary objectives and constraints. In the hydraulic turbomachinery design problems, more than one operating points are considered, leading to an increased cost per evaluation. Thus makes the reduction in the number of evaluations required to reach the optimal solution(s) absolutely necessary.  Finally, the blade airfoil of the 3D compressor cascade installed at LTT/NTUA, aiming at minimum total pressure losses, is optimized.     


This PhD thesis is based on EAs developed during a couple of previous PhDs \cite{phd_Giotis,phd_Karakasis,phd_Kampolis,phd_Vera} performed at the Parallel CFD \& Optimization unit of LTT/NTUA (PCOpt/NTUA). These PhD theses created the algorithmic basis or platform,  which the newly proposed methods were built upon. This EA-based platform, known as the EASY (Evolutionary Algorithm SYstem \cite{EASYsite}) includes, the basic EA, optionally enhanced by parallel search (Parallel EA or PEA), incorporation of ANNs as metamodels (MAEAs) and hierarchical optimization schemes (Hierarchical EA or HEA) provided fertile ground for the development of the new methods proposed by this PhD thesis.
