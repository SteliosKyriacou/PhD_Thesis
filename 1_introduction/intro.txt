The AEA was also used for the optimization of heat transfer systems, such as
geothermal power plants and ground source heat pump systems. Regarding the
geothermal power plants, the design and the development of an Organic Rankine
Cycle (ORC) prototype, using low temperature geothermal resources, was the main
goal of the European project LOW-BIN (Efficient Low Temperature Geothermal
Binary Power, FP6). CRES (Centre for Renewable Energy Sources and Saving,
Greece) was the coordinator of this project and the contribution of PCOpt/LTT,
as reflected in this thesis, was to provide expertise on optimization methods for the
design of an efficient, low-cost ORC.
